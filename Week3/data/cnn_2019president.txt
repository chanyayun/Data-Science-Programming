China's military warns against growing threat from Taiwan 'separatists' The language regarding Taiwan in the white paper -- "China's National Defense in the New Era" -- was noticeably stronger compared to the last major defense report in 2015, which only fleetingly mentioned the island.

The white paper, the first such major defense policy document since Chinese President Xi Jinping began his second term in 2017, calls for greater modernization of the country's military, while emphasizing China's goal of peaceful development.
A Chinese invasion of Taiwan would be a bloody, logistical nightmare
China's defense budget is one of the largest in the world, totaling just over $151 billion in 2017, according to the paper -- which is still far below that of the United States.
At a press conference Wednesday, Defense Ministry spokesman Wu Qian reiterated the paper's central points, declaring Taiwan independence a threat to the sovereignty of China.
"To seek Taiwan independence will get nowhere and China never allow any part of its territory to be separated," he said.
When asked about mass protests in the semi-autonomous Chinese city of Hong Kong in recent weeks, Wu said that the military were watching the situation closely.
He then reminded journalists of the Hong Kong law that allows the local government to request assistance in maintaining public order from the People's Liberation Army garrison in the city, but did not suggest troops should or would be deployed in the near future.

US 'undermining global stability'
The release of the defense white paper comes after an unusually long four-day stopover by Taiwan's Tsai to the US in early July -- en route to the Caribbean -- the latest sign of warming ties between Taipei and Washington despite intense hostility from Beijing.
China criticized the US for its recent decision to sell more than $2 billion in tanks and anti-air missiles to Taiwan. It also accused the US of undermining "global stability," while saying international strategic competition was on the rise overall.
China holds drills in Taiwan Strait, calls for sanctions against US companies
"(The US) has provoked and intensified competition among major countries, significantly increased its defense expenditure, pushed for additional capacity in nuclear, outer space, cyber and missile defense," the white paper said.
When asked about the recent confirmation of China hawk Mark Esper as the new US Defense Secretary, Chinese military spokesman Wu simply wished him the best and struck an optimistic tone on China-US military ties during Esper's tenure.
"But I want to emphasize ... that China's sovereignty, security and developmental interests are not to be encroached," he added.
One change to the 2019 report, compared to 2015, is the tight grip that President Xi has over China's military, with copious references appearing in the white paper to the "new era" of Xi's signature ideology.
"Guided by Xi Jinping's thinking on strengthening the military, China's national defense in the new era will stride forward along its own path to build a stronger military," the report concluded. Why China is challenging Australia for influence over the Pacific Islands The Pacific Islands are home to fewer than 10 million people -- slightly less than the population of Sweden -- are thousands of miles from Beijing and have a combined GDP of about $33.77 billion, less than 1% of China's total GDP.
But that hasn't stopped the money flooding in, building bridges, roads and an airport.
In Australia, some analysts fear their country's influence is under threat.
"Australia is certainly very worried about the level of investment (from China)," said Michael O'Keefe, an expert on Pacific foreign relations at Melbourne's La Trobe University.
Prime Minister Morrison has made the Pacific Islands more of a priority than his predecessors since he came to power last year. As he announced a 2 billion Australian dollar ($1.5 billion) infrastructure fund for the region in November, he said: "Australia cannot take its influence in the Southwest Pacific for granted.
"And sadly, I think too often we have."
So why is China investing so much in this part of the world?
First thing's first: What's China doing in the South Pacific?
In many ways, China is doing things differently.
In the past, Australia has taken what some see as a paternalistic approach in the Pacific Islands, investing in health, education and governance -- the things it thinks the nations need.
But the approach hasn't necessarily had the desired impact. Although Australia -- and other countries -- have been investing aid in the region for years, economic growth is slow. That's partly due to the geographic isolation of the islands and their small populations, but has been worsened by their vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters.
In most Pacific Island countries, more than 20% of the population is unable to afford all their basic needs, according to the World Bank.
That has prompted questions about the effectiveness of aid.
In papers in 2003 and 2010, Australian economist Helen Hughes said that "aid has failed in the Pacific," because it undercut the private sector, impacting employment and economic growth. But Australian economist Matthew Dornan and Jonathan Pryke, director of the Pacific Islands Program at the Lowy Institute, argued in 2017 that aid has raised "living standards beyond what they would be without aid." The Lowy Institute is a non-profit Australian think tank set up in 2003, which receives half of its funding from donations.

China, by contrast, is asking Pacific Island countries where they most need investment. That has tended to result in Beijing funding large-scale infrastructure projects.
Data from the Lowy Institute on the eight countries where both Australia and China are investing shows that in all but one of the nations, China's biggest spend was on an infrastructure project, while all but one of Australia's top projects were non-infrastructure.
In Papua New Guinea, for instance, China completed a $85 million road upgrade in 2017. Meanwhile, Australia has so far spent $219 million on an initiative to deliver essential drugs such as vaccines, and increase health education, especially around the spread of HIV.
In 2018, Australia's Minister for International Development and the South Pacific, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, blasted China for funding "useless buildings" that islands couldn't pay back, but didn't refer to any projects specifically. China lodged a formal diplomatic protest against the minister, calling her remarks "full of prejudice and bias."

There's another difference between the two players: how the money is delivered.
While Australia gives its aid through grants with no obligation for repayment, most of China's spending is in the form of loans, according to the Lowy Institute.
Many of the Chinese loans were taken between 2006 and 2010, said the Lowy Institute's Jonathan Pryke. This was during a "gold rush" period when China was increasingly lending to countries around the world, including in Africa. The loans usually have a grace period of five to 10 years, according to Pryke. So far, there's no record of any Pacific Island countries paying China back, Lowy Institute research found.
Earlier this year, the US Ambassador to Australia, Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr., described China's spending in the Pacific as "payday loan" diplomacy -- intentionally getting countries to take on unsustainable debts in order to buy political leverage. US Vice President Mike Pence has echoed his sentiment.
But the data doesn't back up these claims.
Of the 14 Pacific Island nations, six are rated as being at a high risk of debt distress by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), meaning they are likely to default on their loans, and three are at a moderate risk.

But last year, Australian researchers Rohan Fox and Matthew Dornan found that while China is the biggest bilateral lender in the region, Tonga was the only country where Chinese lending dominated. In several other countries, multilateral lending was the main source of debt.
Furthermore, a recent paper by independent, US-based research provider Rhodium Group found that when China renegotiated its debt with over-leveraged countries, it was usually to the advantage of the borrower. But the authors cautioned that might not be true in the future: "Beijing could still use loan renegotiations to advance foreign and domestic policy objectives."
Many countries have welcomed China's investment. Vanuatu, which received an $80 million loan to build a wharf, thanked the Chinese government for funding projects that no other donor would help with.
On Monday, PNG's Prime Minister James Marape said his country was open to investors from all countries.
"Whether they are from (China), or Australia, or right across the world, is inconsequential and irrelevant to us," he told reporters.
So why is China investing in the Pacific Islands?
That's the billion-dollar question: Why does China want to pour money into isolated countries, with small economies that might not be able to pay back their debts?
If you ask China, it says its spending is benign.

"China, based on equal, mutually beneficial, open and sustainable principles, keeps providing genuine assistance to Pacific Island countries without any political attachment," a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson told CNN in a faxed comment, adding that China had improved the livelihood of Pacific Island people and "won wide acclaim."
"Is China's assistance good or bad? Is it a 'debt trap' or a 'pie in the sky'? The island countries and the people have the final say," the spokesperson said.
There are also sound economic reasons for China to be in the South Pacific, including sourcing raw materials.
Many of the South Pacific islands are rich with resources such as timber, minerals and fish. Since 2011, Beijing has invested more in Papua New Guinea (PNG) -- which is home to gold, nickel mines, liquified natural gas and timber forests -- than any other Pacific Island.

It might also want to help support ethnically Chinese people who live in those countries, said James Batley, an Asia-Pacific expert at Australian National University.
Statistics on the number of Chinese living in the South Pacific are scarce, but in 2006, the South Pacific islands were already home to an estimated 80,000 Chinese.
Some were descended from Chinese traders who settled in the region in the 1800s, while others migrated more recently to work on Chinese construction projects. In the 2000s, anti-Chinese sentiment resulted in riots in the Solomon Islands, PNG and Tonga, where a fatal unrest prompted Beijing to send a charter plane to expatriate around 200 Chinese nationals. The issues behind the riots have differed. In PNG, which suffers from high unemployment, for instance, the hostility was towards Chinese business owners.
Beijing has tried to improve local relations, changing tactics from bringing over its own construction workers to hiring more local staff, said University of the South Pacific's Gounder.
Then, of course, there are the diplomatic reasons China might want to be in the Pacific.
OK, so what are the diplomatic reasons?
First, there's the issue of Taiwan, which Beijing claims sovereignty over.
Only 16 nations and the Holy See officially recognize Taiwan as an independent state, and six of them are in the South Pacific. For years, China has been attempting to win over Taiwan's few remaining allies and encourage them to accept its "One China" principle.

Of the six, three have strong ties to the US, which has what it describes as a "robust unofficial relationship" to Taiwan, an island of 23.5 million people.
Taiwan also invests in the South Pacific -- it has spent $215.87 million between 2011 and 2017, compared with China's $1.21 billion, according to Lowy Institute data.
Papua New Guinea, where both Taiwan and China invest, downgraded its diplomatic relations with Taiwan last year, which Taipei said was due to pressure from Beijing.
The Solomon Islands, which recognizes Taiwan, is expected to decide whether it will cut ties with Taiwan in the next few months. The country's former Prime Minister Gordon Darcy Lilo said changing course could boost investment to the country. Taiwan has invested there, China is its top trading partner, according to a 2018 report from the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission.
There are other reasons why China would want a Pacific Island nation on its side. Even though the entire population of the 14 Pacific Island nations is around the same size as a Chinese city, China still has the same voting power as a Pacific Island at the United Nations General Assembly.
Pacific Island nations can be powerful friends despite their small size.
What else is at stake?
The islands could serve as destinations for future military bases.
In April 2018, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that officials from China and Vanuatu were in talks about setting up a permanent military presence on the island. Both Beijing and Vanuatu denied the reports.
A Chinese military base would be seen as a problem in the United States, which has had a presence in the South Pacific since World War II.
The US still has military outposts on islands in this region, such as on Guam and the Marshall Islands.

The islands running from Japan to Taiwan and the Philippines, and from Japan to Guam and Palau form lines known as the first and second island chain. Academics and military theorists see them as a way for the US to contain China from gaining a strategic position in the region.
A 2018 US-China Economic and Security Review Commission report found that a Chinese military base or facility in the South Pacific could prevent US military access to the region -- and affect key partners, New Zealand and Australia.
"Such a development could expand China's monitoring and surveillance capabilities in the region, helping Beijing mitigate US military presence in the region," the report authors wrote.
Chinese bases in the South Pacific would also raise security concerns for Australia.
Three of Australia's five main maritime trade routes pass through the Pacific. Even if China didn't threaten these routes, its presence could expose them to the possibility of future issues, which in turn could have serious implications for Australia's economy.
I totally don't rule out a military base in any Pacific Island country
Neelesh Gounder, Fiji University of the South Pacific
As Pryke puts it, a Chinese base in the South Pacific would likely "profoundly change" the way Australia looked at national defense and national security. In a Lowy Institute poll this year, 55% of those surveyed said if China opened a military base in a Pacific Island country, that would be a critical threat to the nation's vital interests.
Australia and the US have military plans of their own. Last year, the US, Australia and Papua New Guinea announced they would partner to redevelop a naval base on PNG's Manus Island, best known for a controversial and now shuttered migrant detention center. During World War II, the island was home to a Japanese base that was captured and taken over by the Allies.
Pacific Islands Private Sector Organization board chair Stephen Lyon, who lives in the Cook Islands, believes most Pacific Islands don't want to be further militarized.
But Fiji-based poverty and growth researcher Gounder said if there was a mutually beneficial deal, he didn't think South Pacific islands would say no to a Chinese base -- or an Australian one, for that matter.
"I totally don't rule out a military base in any Pacific Island country," he said.
What is Australia worried about?
To China, its investment in the Pacific Islands is small compared with the scale of its flagship multibillion Belt and Road Initiative.
Beijing invested over $1.2 billion in the 14 South Pacific nations between 2011 and 2017, but last year alone, it pledged $60 billion in aid, investment and loans to Africa.
In contrast, in the same period, Australia spent $6.3 billion in aid in the South Pacific, making the region one of the main beneficiaries of Australian aid.
Australia has good reason to make that investment. Since the 1950s, it has been part of an agreement with the US and New Zealand, making it responsible for the security of the Pacific Islands. If a Pacific Island country was to encounter a crisis, there is an expectation that Australia -- as a good neighbor -- would assist.

And that means Australia has a lot more to lose.
Any conflict or crisis could increase refugee flows to Australia or a need for troops to be deployed. After a period of ethnic violence in the Solomon Islands, Australia spent an estimated 2.8 billion Australian dollars ($1.96 billion) on a 14-year mission to stabilize the nation.
"We are essentially the superpower in the Pacific and it's very important that we play our role," then-Australian Justice Minister Michael Keenan said in 2017, when the mission ended.
Pacific Islands Private Sector Organization's Lyon said that while it was true that neither country was entirely altruistic, Australia had long term partnerships in the region. "China has a very specific geostrategic focus in the region," he said.
When asked whether Australia needed to be concerned about China's increased role, and why Australia was stepping up efforts in the region, an Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesperson said it was in the country's national interests to promote stability, security and prosperity in the Pacific.

"The Pacific has significant investment needs, and Australia welcomes all investment that supports sustainable development in line with the priorities and ambitions of Pacific countries, is delivered transparently, and does not impose heavy debt burdens," the spokesperson said.
What does the Pacific think about all this?
While Taiwan-aligned Nauru has publicly pushed back on China's involvement, many Pacific Island countries have embraced the additional investment. "We are indeed very grateful," Fijian politician Ratu Epeli Nailatikau said earlier this year.
Australia's aid spend in the Pacific Islands dropped off in 2013, according to Lowy Institute data. But China's involvement has been a catalyst for traditional Pacific Island partners, such as Australia and New Zealand, to increase their involvement in the region.
Morrison's $1.5 billion "step up" infrastructure investment program for the Pacific Islands was a "direct response" to push out Chinese influence and maintain Australia's position as the primary partner in the region, said La Trobe University's O'Keefe.

Cook Islands-based Lyon said that, ultimately, the Pacific Islands are autonomous states that direct their own foreign policy -- the idea that outside powers might be able to influence them, as they had during their colonial pasts, was "old-fashioned."
"The Pacific Islands are open to money wherever it comes from," he said. "At the moment, I think the Pacific feels like it's getting something that benefits us." China's economic slowdown is real, but it's not just about tariffs But analysts argue that the yearlong trade war is not the biggest drag on the world's second largest economy. The slowdown has as much to do with a debt mountain and cautious consumers.

Debt and defaults
China has been struggling for years to rein in high levels of debt, arising from a massive stimulus package launched during the 2008 financial crisis.
While the stimulus boosted economic growth, it resulted in a $40 trillion mountain of government, corporate and household debt worth more than 300% of China's GDP as of March 2019, according to a report from the Washington-based Institute of International Finance this week.
China's overall debt now accounts for about 15% of the global total, the IIF added.
The Chinese government has reacted by tightening regulations in the financial system, scaling back bank lending, and clamping down on unregulated lending, also known as shadow banking.
But these efforts to reduce China's reliance on debt-fueled growth have also made it more difficult for companies to obtain financing, especially private sector firms that usually find it harder to raise funds from banks than larger but less efficient state-run firms.
China's car market fell off a cliff this year. It faces a long road back
Last year, defaults by Chinese companies hit a record high. In the first six months of this year, the number of defaults increased more than threefold from the same period last year, according to data compiled by Wind, a Chinese financial data provider.
"Credit is still not flowing to the sectors that need it most," said Stephen Innes, managing partner of Singapore-based investment firm Vanguard Markets. Innes estimates that around 50% of the defaults came from China's large manufacturing sector, mostly by private companies.
Consumers are cutting back
The hit to growth this year has come from Chinese consumers, who hold off spending because they worry about the economy's future and rising personal debt levels. Elevated property prices have also strained their purchasing power.
Retail sales grew by 8.4% in the first half, down from 9% in the same period last year. And some of the world's biggest companies are feeling the pinch.
Apple's (AAPL) sales in China have tumbled. Its revenue in the Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, dropped 21.5% in the second quarter from the same period a year ago. Greater China accounted for about 18% of Apple's total revenue.
Weak car sales are also a big part of the story. Total spending on cars increased by just 1.2% in the first six months of the year.
Ford said earlier this month that it sold nearly 22% fewer vehicles in China during the second quarter than in the same period a year ago. General Motors posted a 12% drop in vehicle sales in China for the quarter.
Steady deceleration
China's economic slowdown predates the trade war by several years.
Growth hit a record high of 14.2% in 2007 but has been steadily falling since as China grapples with several pressures on its economy.
The government has lowered its growth target to a range of 6% to 6.5% for this year.
China's efforts to shift its economy from one focused on manufacturing to one driven by technology and services have also contributed to the slowdown.
Beijing has been cutting excess capacity in heavy industries such as steel, cement, shipbuilding, while encouraging domestic firms to shift to higher value-added areas.
While that transition has seen the rise of giants like Tencent (TCEHY), Alibaba (BABA) and Huawei, it has also caused growing pains as traditional manufacturing workers struggle to make the shift.

China has recently cut taxes and increased infrastructure spending in a bid to prevent a hard landing for the economy, but analysts say the country's model of state-sponsored growth may no longer work.
"Continued reliance upon infrastructure projects with decreasing marginal returns seems unlikely to revive China's economy, and its state-run capital allocation system is an irrational and inefficient mess," said Brock Silvers, managing director for Shanghai-based Kaiyuan Capital.
"Beijing has been working furiously to fix the economy... but its old methods may not fix its new problems," he added. Chaos reigns in Washington At one point, the presiding officer, Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Missouri, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, laid down his gavel and walked out in frustration.
Here are the 4 Republicans who voted to condemn Trump's racist tweets
Republicans twisted themselves in knots to avoid angering constituents by condemning the President's tweets, and sought to rebrand them as a patriotic denunciations of the extreme socialism they say is infecting the Democratic Party.
"I think this party has been very clear, we are the party of Lincoln," House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said.
The Republican strategy was a reminder that most lawmakers in divided, gerrymandered America are more concerned about being primaried by a more radical activist than seeking the disappearing political center ground. It also underscored the omnipresent power of a President who warned colleagues whose history shows no previous sign of being reluctant to condemn racism not to show "weakness."
In an incongruous moment, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was stumped when asked what he would do if someone told his Taiwan-born wife to go back to the nationalist island.

In the twilight zone of the White House, the man who unleashed the fury, Trump, expressed disgust at the "vile, horrible statements" said by the women he targeted over the color of their skin.
In a bizarre moment outside, senior Trump aide Kellyanne Conway demanded to know the ethnicity of a reporter who asked her which country the four American lawmakers should return to.
In a later Fox News interview, Conway said the women represented "the dark underbelly" of disrespect for America's military.
And in another surreal twist to the situation, Conway's husband George earlier penned his latest devastating op-ed blasting his wife's boss as a "racist President" beyond the bounds of human decency.
But white nationalist Richard Spencer complained to CNN that Trump wasn't going far enough, saying he gave the movement nothing "outside racist tweets" that seem like the came from "a drunk uncle."

Cooper shines light on Conway's 'dark underbelly' comment 05:23
At times, it was hard to believe such scenes -- inciting buried hatreds and toxicity that only racial politics can provoke -- were taking place one-fifth of the way through the 21st Century.
Yet this is what the Trump presidency has wrought. There is a price for the constant tearing of some of the nation's deepest divides. Some of it was on display in the rising tensions and distemper in Washington on Tuesday.
The lasting impact of such conscious polarization on the part of a President -- an office holder who is normally looked on to heal national wounds -- is not yet clear. But it is likely to be discombobulating and to leave the country more torn and difficult to govern whenever it is that Trump leaves the political scene.
Even Anthony Scaramucci, the short-lived former White House communications director and longtime Trump friend, rebuked the President's "bully-ish, Neanderthal-ish" racist comments.
And Tuesday is only the beginning. Since Trump has put white nationalist fear mongering at the center of his reelection campaign, the atmosphere will surely worsen as 2020 looms.
"This is not going to be the last time this happens. We are going to be having this discussion a lot in the next 17 months because he thinks it is to his advantage to do it," David Axelrod, a CNN senior political analyst and former Barack Obama strategist said on "The Lead with Jake Tapper."
"And, yes, it is important for us as a country to express our moral outrage about these tactics, but at some point, they have to be discussed as tactics."
Under normal circumstances, it would be a legacy-defining moment if a President was rebuked for racist language by the one half of a rival branch of government.
That it is not is a measure of how Trump broke the political mold, enjoys impunity for his boundless conduct and has utterly co-opted his party.
In the warped political calculations of the Trump era, the developments in the last few days might even come to be seen as some kind of political victory for the President.
By singling out Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, he hoped to make some of the most radical Democrats the face of the party ahead of 2020. They have promised not to take Trump's "bait" but conservative media is making sure that Trump's base sees plenty of the quartet. It's also painting the President's racism as an example of liberal hysteria and yet more victimization of Trump by critics who are obsessed with identity politics.
And the President is not going to lose any sleep about being censured by the House. He's always framed himself as the scourge of the Washington elite and he knows GOP control of the Senate means he won't be embarrassed in the other chamber.
And for a day at least, the Democrats were distracted from their plans to pass a positive agenda on issues like health care, education and climate change that preoccupy their voters.
Normally, at moments of Trump-induced dysfunction, commentators note that the President engineers chaos as a master stroke to keep his political foes off balance.
His instinctive, incessant stoking of his base is interpreted as an effort to emulate his shock 2016 election win. Yet the President's inflammatory rhetoric during the midterm elections seemed to alienate many more moderate voters who he will still need to win a second term.
He's playing a risky political game -- though it may be the only one he really knows how to play.

Rep. John Lewis: Segregationists told us to 'go back' 01:52
Even in the most distasteful Washington storms, political leaders grope for whatever incremental cover they can find.
By presenting herself as the face of the resolution condemning Trump, Pelosi was able to mend bonds with the four congresswomen with whom she was involved in a spat last week about their flouting of party discipline as she seeks to protect the more moderate caucus members who won her the House in 2018.
It seems more than a few days ago that Ocasio-Cortez claimed the speaker was "singling out" freshmen women of color.
For a few days at least, Pelosi's steps to confront and condemn the President could alleviate some of the pressure building up from restive Democrats angry that she has slow walked impeachment.
And she succeeded in getting Republicans on the record denying that Trump's suggestion that the four American lawmakers "go back" to their "broken and crime infested" countries is racist.
McConnell, who has no appetite to anger the Trump base as he seeks to hold onto the Senate next year, attempted to ease the political pressure on his own troops.
"I think there's been a consensus that political rhetoric has really gotten way, way overheated all across the political spectrum," he said, mostly blaming Democrats and not at all blaming Trump.
"We all know politics is a contact sport, but it's about time we lowered the temperature all across the board. All of us ought to contribute to a better level of discourse."
Asked by CNN's Manu Raju what he would say if someone told his wife, Elaine Chao, Trump's Transportation secretary to "go back" to where she came from, McConnell took refuge in a non sequitur argument about how he was a fan of legal immigration. China holds drills in Taiwan Strait, calls for sanctions against US companies Chinese Ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai made it clear on Friday on Twitter that any attempt
s
by the US government to "split" Taiwan from China would provoke a swift response.
"Those who play with fire will only get themselves burned. Period," he tweeted.

'Hot-button issue'
The US State Department gave its approval of the multibillion-dollar arms deal with Taiwan on July 8, which includes 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks and Stinger missiles.
In response, China's Foreign Ministry said it would impose sanctions on any companies selling arms to Taiwan, although it didn't single any out by name.
Speaking on Monday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he wasn't in a position to "disclose more details" at present.
"Please believe that China always keeps its promises and its actions always produce results," he said.
Among the companies that could be affected would be Raytheon Missile Systems, who make the Stingers, or General Dynamics Land Systems, who are responsible for the Abrams tanks.
"In order to safeguard national interests, China will impose sanctions on US companies involved in the arms sales to Taiwan," spokesman Geng said Friday.
US would be 'stupid' to treat China as an enemy, senior diplomat says
La Trobe University associate professor James Leibold said that Taiwan was being used as a bargaining chip by both US and China and the threat of sanctions showed Beijing felt ready to escalate the issue.
Taiwan was becoming more of a "hot-button issue" for both governments due to a push for closer relations from Washington, said Leibold.
"Clearly some in the Trump administration want to strengthen the alliance with Taiwan, and as we all know the Taiwan issue has always been a deeply sensitive one for the People's Republic of China," he said.
Taiwan has been self-ruled since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, which saw the Communist Party take control of the mainland and the Nationalist government forced to flee to the island.
But Beijing still views the island as their territory and has worked consistently for decades to try to threaten or cajole it into rejoining with the mainland.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has regularly called for the reunification of Taiwan, even refusing to rule out force in a major speech in January.
In the past year, China has ramped up its military exercises around the island. It held live fire drills in the Taiwan Strait in 2018, while Chinese fighter jets crossed the maritime border separating the island from the mainland in a rare incursion in April.
Taiwan's Ministry of Defense said that the PLA's drills on Sunday were "nothing more than routine exercises," according to Taiwan's news agency CNA, adding that the island's military was ready to respond to any threats.
Taiwan president defiant
The rise in tensions comes amid a visit to the US by Taiwan President Tsai on her way to visit the island's allies in the Caribbean.
Tsai is spending an unusually long stopover of four nights in the country, including two nights in New York. There is no confirmation of what meetings she is expected to have while in the country.
Her visit alone was enough to antagonize the Chinese government, which opposes any official contact between Washington and Taipei.
Taiwan's Tsai Ing-wen warns against 'overseas forces' at beginning of US trip
"Allowing Tsai to 'stop over' violates the #oneChina principle ... China urges the US to properly handle the Taiwan issue to prevent damaging China US relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait," China's embassy in the US said on its official Twitter Friday.
But Tsai hasn't been deterred by the Chinese government's opposition, holding a public meeting with representatives of Taiwan's remaining 17 allies in New York.
"Taiwan will firmly defend our democratic system. Our democracy has not come easily and is now facing the threat and penetration of overseas forces," said Tsai, implicitly criticizing Beijing. On her way back to Taipei, Tsai will stop over in Denver, Colorado.
While in the Caribbean, Tsai will visit St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia and Haiti.
Taiwan's leader has taken an increasingly strident anti-China stance ahead of the national election in January 2020 where she will seek re-election.
It was announced on Monday that she will face opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate Han Kuo-yu, who won his party's nomination with 44% of the vote.
Despite being viewed as more pro-Beijing than Tsai, Han appeared to take a harder stance against further integration with the mainland in June, amid increasingly heated protests in Hong Kong.
"'One Country, Two Systems' can never be implemented in Taiwan. Taiwanese people can never accept it, unless it's over my dead body," Han told a rally in June. Trump's most openly racist rhetoric yet is not at all surprising But Trump risks opening divides that will take years to heal.
By telling the four women — three of whom were born in the US — to "go back" to where they came from, Trump employed the most basic and crude racial taunt. He also implicitly rejected the motto emblazoned on America's Great Seal — E Pluribus Unum — from many one. He is implying that any American who is not white and native born has no place in the country.
Trump tweets racist attacks at progressive Democratic congresswomen
In a less polarized time, Trump's tweets may have been disqualifying and an outrageous political twist. But Trump forged his entry into politics based on a racist slur against the nation's first black President Barack Obama and he has become ever more willing to use such tactics to save his own presidency. And he's rarely paid a price.
The silence from Republicans Sunday about Trump's tweets was near universal, emphasizing how his outlandish behavior is tolerated by lawmakers who represent half of the electorate and who won't risk their own political careers to condemn him.
With just more than 15 months to go before the next president is chosen, the already poisonous tone of Trump's reelection campaign seems almost certain to become far, far worse. The question is whether Trump will alienate sufficient crops of more moderate voters to swing the White House to Democrats or whether his raging culture wars will maximize turnout in his own party and hand him a second term.
His attack is a logical extension of an election strategy that is clearly designed to exploit racial and social divides.
Trump's tweets came on a day when border agents started raids targeting undocumented migrants — bolstering Trump's scorched earth immigration rhetoric at the center of his 2020 campaign.
AOC responds to Trump's racist attacks: 'You cannot accept that we don't fear you'
They took the President's current fear and conspiracy-laden politics to a fresh peak, after he warned last week of "illegal aliens in our midst" and maligned the patriotism of his critics at inflammatory White House events.
In the face of widespread outrage -- even British Prime Minister Theresa May's office called the tweets "completely unacceptable" -- Trump refused to back down, calling Monday morning for the "radical left congresswomen" to apologize "to our Country, the people of Israel and even to the Office of the President, for the foul language they have used, and the terrible things they have said. So many people are angry at them & their horrible & disgusting actions!"
At the White House, Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff Marc Short struggled to come up with a credible defense of the President. He said Trump's choice of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, a naturalized American who was born in Taiwan, proved that he was not racist since she was "an Asian woman of color." He also highlighted Pence's role in presiding over a naturalization ceremony on July 4.
Short also claimed that Trump was specifically targeting one of the congresswomen, Somali-born Rep. Ilhan Omar -- who has been criticized for anti-Semitic remarks -- even though the President's tweets indicate otherwise.

Will Republicans condemn Trump's racist attacks? 01:29
Trump targeted the liberal Democratic lawmakers in a flurry of Sunday morning tweets that reverberated with extremist white nationalistic sentiment.
He hit out at congresswomen who he claimed "originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world ... now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run."
"Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done."
A House Democratic feud was nearing a crisis point. Then Trump got involved.
Trump was referring to four lawmakers who have been in conflict with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Omar from Minnesota, Michigan's Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley from Massachusetts. All of the women have been outspoken about Trump's immigration policies.
Of that quartet, only Omar — who is originally from Somalia — was not born in the United States, but she immigrated to the United States when she was young and became a citizen at the age of 17, according to The New York Times.
The reason why Trump's attack was not surprising is because it fits into a pattern of racially charged rhetoric that he has been willing to use in private life — dating back to his comments on the Central Park Five and the "birtherism" campaign against Obama.
While it is shocking to see such open racism expressed by a President of the United States, Sunday's tweets were far from the first time that Trump has dealt in such toxicity in office.
He has painted a picture of hordes of criminals mobbing the US southern border in an invasion force of undocumented migrants. He has said America can't take any more immigrants because it is "full." He reportedly referred to some African nations as "sh**hole countries and expressed a preference for more immigrants from Norway — a predominantly white nation.
The debate about whether Trump is a "racist" that pops up after such comments seems increasingly academic.
Ahead of ICE raids, NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio says Trump trying to 'divide' America
Democratic politicians, including Ocasio-Cortez and Pelosi were quick to condemn Trump's tweets. In the short-term, they might have backfired politically for Trump by helping soothe antagonism in the two wings of the House Democratic caucus.
Democratic presidential candidates also were quick to condemn Trump, as his remarks played directly into their narrative that he abhors American values and is unfit to be President.
"America's strength is and has always been rooted in our diversity. But President Trump continues to spew hateful rhetoric, sow division, and stoke racial tensions for his own political gain," Democratic front runner Joe Biden tweeted.
New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker told CNN: "This president is hurting our country and bigotry like he just spewed is something we need to end in this nation."

Fox News hosts laugh off Trump's racist attacks on Dems 01:56
The lesson of Trump's political career is that while his tweets will cause outrage — they will not measurably reshape the political environment in the short-term.
Republicans who support Trump by margins of close to 90% in recent polls have long ago made peace with the President's outrageousness or are willing to look the other way as he implements a conservative agenda, especially in the courts.
Trump's incessant catering to his base means he has little to fear politically from the modern Republican Party.
Democrats condemn ICE raids as 'inhumane,' 'tear families apart'
Media outrage at Trump's behavior will play into the persecution complex and hatred of political correctness that the President has made central to his appeal to his closest supporters. Trump's aides may start to deny the clear implications of his tweets and try to stir up new anti-media hatred in his base.
During Trump's campaign in 2016 and in the early months of his presidency, some Republican leaders offered token criticism when he veered into flagrant racial rhetoric.
But the political reality is that there is little to be gained -- and much to be lost from taking on the President directly for GOP lawmakers.
The President has only one hope of winning reelection -- thanks to the way that he has conducted his presidency. He must hope his fired up political base will show up to the polls in greater numbers than voters supporting Democrats that he is painting as extreme and bent on a communist takeover.
That's why Sunday's tweets are probably not a historical aberration but a taste of things to come. Taiwan's Tsai Ing-wen warns against 'overseas forces' at beginning of US trip Outside her New York hotel, clashes broke out between pro-Taipei and pro-Beijing protesters, Taiwan's official news agency CNA reported.
Tsai's extended stay, which comes amid a protracted trade dispute between the US and China, risks inflaming tensions and furthering the perception that the White House is seeking to bolster ties with Taipei.
On Monday the US State Department approved the potential sale of more than $2 billion in tanks and anti-air missiles to the Taiwan military, sparking a furious reaction from Beijing.

Taiwan president issues a warning to the world 07:11
Taiwan has been self-ruled since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, which saw the Communist Party take control of the mainland and the Nationalist government forced to flee to the island.
Tsai's 12-day itinerary is aimed at shoring up relations with four Caribbean nations that continue to formally recognize the government in Taipei and not Beijing, and includes stops in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia and Haiti.
In a speech prior to her departure from Taiwan early Thursday, Tsai pledged to use the trip to increase international cooperation. "Freedom, democracy and sustainability are the Taiwanese values we want to share with all our good friends in the world," said Tsai. "We will by no means restrict ourselves to a small corner of the Taiwan Strait."
Though the US broke formal diplomatic relations with Taipei in 1979, it continues to maintain close ties with Taiwan.
In May, US National Security Adviser John Bolton met with one of Taiwan's top defense officials, David Lee, the first meeting between the top security advisers of both governments since the formal split.
"Our interest in Taiwan, especially as it relates to these military sales, is to promote peace and stability across the straits, across the region," US State Department spokesman Morgan Ortagus said in advance of Tsai's arrival in New York, Tuesday.
"There's no change, of course, in our longstanding 'One China' policy," added Ortagus, referencing the policy under which Washington officially recognizes the Communist government in Beijing as the only legal government of China.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has regularly called for the reunification of Taiwan with the mainland, even refusing to rule out force in a major speech in January.
The Chinese military held live fire drills in the Taiwan Strait in 2018, while Chinese fighter jets crossed the maritime border separating the island from the mainland in a rare incursion in April.
Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe told an audience in Singapore in June that if anyone attempted to "split" Taiwan from China, "the Chinese military has no choice but to fight at all costs for national unity."
Tsai is currently faced with an uphill battle for re-election in elections scheduled for January, against an resurgent opposition Nationalist party -- known as Kuomintang -- and is said to have attempted to polish her anti-Beijing credentials in a bid to win votes. US would be 'stupid' to treat China as an enemy, senior diplomat says Talks unexpectedly stalled in early May, with both sides blaming the other.

While trade negotiations between the two countries now seem to be back on track, tensions between Washington and Beijing are still rising on a number of fronts.
On Monday, the Trump administration approved a new $2 billion arms sale to Taiwan, including hundreds of Stinger missiles and 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks. The Chinese government has yet to respond to the approval. But in March China's Defense Ministry said that Beijing was "firmly opposed to US arms sales to Taiwan and US military contact with Taiwan."
US approves major arms sale to Taiwan amid trade tensions with Beijing
In his speech Monday, Le alluded to accusations made by China's state-run media that the US was deliberately delaying student visa approvals for applicants from China.
"This practice of using blood lineage and race as a label to hamper people-to-people exchanges between the two countries is unpopular," the Chinese diplomat said.
US President Trump told reporters after his meeting with Xi on June 29 that he wanted to see more Chinese students studying in the US.
Le is considered to be a rising figure in the Chinese Foreign Ministry. Chinese politics expert Bill Bishop said he could be next in line to be Chinese ambassador to the United States.
"Current ambassador Cui Tiankai is well past the normal term here," Bishop said, adding that there had been rumors of Cui's imminent departure before. "Le is the only (potential replacement) I hear from people I consider credible." US approves major arms sale to Taiwan amid trade tensions with Beijing The tanks are valued at up to $2 billion while the portable surface-to-air Stinger missiles are estimated to cost up to $223 million.
The Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency said that the tank sale serves "US national, economic, and security interests by supporting" Taiwan's "continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability." The agency also said that the Stinger missile sale would improve the security and defensive capability of Taiwan, which it called "an important force for political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region."
Neither sale, the agency said, would "alter the basic military balance in the region."
While the US has long provided arms to Taiwan as part of the 40-year-old Taiwan Relations Act, Beijing has long chaffed at those sales.
Trump says he will no longer deal with UK ambassador who labeled him 'inept'
"Although China advocates for peaceful unification with Taiwan, China has never renounced the use of military force, and continues to develop and deploy advanced military capabilities needed for a potential military campaign," a report from the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency warned in May.
The report also warned that Taiwan's traditional military advantages over Beijing in the event of a cross-strait conflict were eroding in the face of China's military modernization efforts.
"Taiwan has historically enjoyed military advantages in the context of a cross-Strait conflict, such as technological superiority and the inherent geographic advantages of island defense, China's multi-decade military modernization effort has eroded or negated many of these advantages," the report added, saying that "although Taiwan is taking important steps to compensate for the growing disparities ... these improvements only partially address Taiwan's declining defensive advantages."
Since 2010, the US has announced more than $15 billion in arms sales to Taiwan.
The US has also been locked in a long running trade dispute with Beijing. On Sunday, President Donald Trump told reporters that "we're doing very well with China" and that his administration's imposition of tariffs on China had helped the negotiations. Pence touts 'most generous system of legal immigration' during naturalization ceremony The 44 new citizens hailed from 26 countries and included an electrician, a banker, a college counselor and an Uber driver, per Pence, who acknowledged the "challenges" of the US immigration system.
"Now as fellow Americans, you'll be a part of many debates in the life of this nation, including debates over immigration in America. And we all know that our current system of immigration faces real challenges," the vice president said, adding, "But to those of you who step forward today, who made the sacrifices and went through the process, let me say on behalf of President Donald Trump and on behalf of the American people, welcome to the American family."
The ceremony came a day after the administration reversed course on adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census. Justice Department lawyers told a federal judge Wednesday that they have been told to try to add the question in a way that's consistent with a Supreme Court ruling following Trump's tweet that "we are absolutely moving forward" with the question.
On Wednesday, the President tweeted a defense against reports of inhumane conditions, extreme overcrowding and thinly stretched resources at Border Patrol facilities, claiming that migrants seeking asylum who were subjected to these conditions "are living far better now than where they came from."

April 9, 2019 - Aides announce that the Dalai Lama has been hospitalized with a chest infection, but is in stable condition. He is discharged two days later. These are 4 winners of the US-China trade war Trump said last week that talks are "back on track" and new tariffs are on hold after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 conference in Japan.
But American business owners were startled in May when the administration escalated tariffs on $200 billion of goods to 25% from 10%, arguing that China reneged on previous agreements. Trump also threatened to impose new tariffs on the remaining Chinese imports, which would hit smartphones, toys, footwear and fish.
The president has suggested that Beijing will agree to a deal because the tariffs he's imposed on Chinese goods are driving away business.
"China is getting absolutely decimated by companies that are leaving China, going to other countries, including our own," he said in an interview with CNBC last month.
But it's unclear whether companies are permanently shifting production outside of China, or simply rerouting goods for minimal processing before being shipped to the United States. Vietnam's customs agency said that it would start cracking down on goods of Chinese origin illegally relabeled "Made in Vietnam" by businesses attempting to avoid the US tariffs, according to a report from Reuters.
It's not always easy to find suppliers outside of China that can manufacture the same good with the same quality and for a cheaper price. It's a process that could take months, or even years. Instead, an importer may decide to eat the cost, betting that Trump will lift the tariffs sooner rather than later. They can also choose to pass the cost on to consumers for the time being.
Missouri-based Cap America imports a majority of its baseball caps from China and embroiders them in the United States. The company is trying a new supplier in Bangladesh to avoid the tariffs, but those orders will only make up about 20% of total imports this year as they test the quality.
"You can't just snap your fingers and switch production. It's a definite process," said CEO Phil Page.
About 40% of companies surveyed in May by the American Chamber of Commerce and its counterpart in Shanghai said they are considering or have already relocated some manufacturing outside of China because of the tariffs. For those that have moved production, about a quarter shifted to Southeast Asia. Fewer than 6% said they have relocated or are considering relocating to the United States.
While imports from countries outside China have significantly increased this year, some production was already moving outside of China to places with even lower wages long before Trump began imposing tariffs. US imports from countries like Vietnam and South Korea have been steadily increasing over the past decade as those countries have ramped up manufacturing of apparel and electronics, respectively.
Taiwan and South Korea are more focused on high-tech items like semiconductors, but Vietnam and Bangladesh still offer competitive wages — making them attractive places to make consumer items like apparel and shoes.

Other Facts:

Her first name is pronounced "Keer-sten."
Speaks Mandarin Chinese. She studied in Taiwan and China during her undergraduate studies at Dartmouth.
Has been a primary force behind legislation that would remove sexual assault allegations from the chain of command in the military, allowing a prosecutor, not the commander, to handle them.
Has introduced a universal paid family leave bill every year between 2014-2019.
As a proponent of the 2nd Amendment, she once had an "A" grade from the NRA. She currently holds an "F."
Was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition while in Congress.
Prior to her appointment to the Senate she held conservative positions on gun control and immigration. She since has apologized and expressed remorse over her past record.

Kirsten Gillibrand officially announces 2020 run 01:53 China tests anti-ship missile in South China Sea, Pentagon says China has claimed almost the entire 1.3 million square mile South China Sea as its sovereign territory, including the area of the Spratlys, which are also claimed in part by the Philippines, Vietnam and Taiwan.
To reinforce its claim, China has created and fortified artificial islands in the chain in the southern part of the South China Sea, despite a pledge made by President Xi Jinping during a White House visit in 2015 that the islands would not become military outposts.
"What's truly disturbing about this act is that it's in direct contradiction to President Xi's statement ... that he would not militarize those man-made outposts," Eastburn said Tuesday.
Ballistic missile can hit moving ships, China says, but experts remain skeptical
"I'm not going to speak on behalf of all the sovereign nations in the region, but I'm sure they agree that (China's) behavior is contrary to its claim to want to bring peace to the region and obviously actions like this are coercive acts meant to intimidate other (South China Sea) claimants," Eastburn added.
But it's not just China that is flexing military muscles in the South China Sea. The US and its allies and partners are beefing up their presence in the region.
In June, one of the US Navy's largest warships, the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan, partnered with one of Japan's largest naval vessels, the helicopter destroyer JS Izumo, for exercises in the South China Sea.

At the weekend, the US Navy announced the littoral combat ship USS Montgomery was making a port call in Davao, Philippines. The shallow-draft ship, designed for action near shorelines and around islands, is expected to be headed to Singapore as part of a stated US Navy plan to put forward-deploy two ships there this year.
As US and China spar, the rest of Asia risks being stuck in the middle
Meanwhile, warships from Australia, Canada and France have been in and around the South China Sea during the last 12-months, as the US encourages allies to support a free and open Indo-Pacific region.
Tensions have been especially high in the Spratlys in the past month, after a Philippine fishing boat sank following a collision with a Chinese fishing boat on June 9.
The Filipino fishermen claimed they were left to drown by the Chinese boat and were only rescued hours later by a Vietnamese boat. China claims its vessel felt threatened by swarming Philippine boats.
The incident was enough for Manila to register a diplomatic protest with Beijing, though the government of President Rodrigo Duterte so far appears to be reluctant to push Beijing too hard on the issue. Tech stocks soar after Trump reverses course on Huawei Trump said Saturday at the G20 in Japan that "US companies can sell their equipment to Huawei," reversing an export ban that had been in place since May. Huawei, one of the largest smartphone manufacturers in the world, has become a major flash point in a larger battle between China and the United States.
The American president also agreed with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to restart trade discussions over the weekend. The developments helped spur the wider stock market higher on Monday. China's benchmark Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP) and Japan's Nikkei (N225) gained over 2%. Major European stock indexes opened higher.
Silvers cautioned investors against going all-in too soon.
"Celebration may be premature, as Trump can easily reinstate his Huawei ban should trade talks falter," he said. "While both parties clearly want a deal, we've yet to see any evidence that remaining issues are any closer to be resolved."
Global markets jump after US and China agree to renew trade talks
The trade truce was bad news for another key bargaining chip in the US-China trade war.
Stocks of companies that sell rare earths, minerals that are widely used in the tech industry, dropped sharply. China controls 90% of the world's rare earth production and has indicated it could use that to put pressure on the United States.
JL Mag Rare-Earth, a top producer of the minerals, dropped 3.5% in Shenzhen on Monday. The stock has more than doubled in the past month since Xi visited the Jiangxi-based company on May 20, signaling that rare earths are a strategic resource that China wants to tighten its control over. Rival company Chengdu Galaxy Magnets fell 2.5%. Canadian warship gets 'warm welcome' from fighter jets, Chinese media say Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang on Thursday acknowledged the presence of the Canadian ships.
"We were clear about the transit of Canadian vessels through the Taiwan Strait and monitored the vessels for the whole process," Ren said.
However, the Chinese state-owned Global Times newspaper put out a post on its official Weibo account Thursday, seemingly mocking the encounter: "The Canadian ships have received a warm welcome from our people's navy and air force," said the post.

Before the buzzing Monday, the closest Chinese jets had come to the Regina was several kilometers, according to Fisher.
Canada is just one of several US allies and partners, including France, Japan and the United Kingdom, that have been sending ships into the South China Sea or through the Taiwan Strait this year.
At the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference in Singapore earlier this month, then-acting US Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan encouraged other countries to conduct such activities to demonstrate a commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific region.
Beijing claims almost the entire 1.3 million square mile South China Sea as its sovereign territory and aggressively asserts its stake, with President Xi Jinping saying it will never give up "any inch of territory."
China bans all meat from Canada alleging forged customs certificates
The flyby of the Canadian warship comes during a time of heightened tensions between Canada and China, following the arrest of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou in Canada in December 2018.
Meng faces extradition to the US over allegations she helped Huawei evade US sanctions on Iran. The Chinese government claims the arrest is politically motivated and is trying stop the extradition from happening.
Shortly after Meng's detention, two Canadians were taken into custody in China, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor.
Both were formally arrested in May, accused of gathering and stealing "sensitive information and other intelligence" since 2017. Separately, Canadian man Robert Lloyd Schellenberg, who had previously been found guilty of trafficking drugs to China, was rapidly retried in January and sentenced to death.
The Canadian government has joined with human rights organizations to call for the release of Kovrig and Spavor, describing their detentions as "arbitrary." A Chinese invasion of Taiwan would be a bloody, logistical nightmare At a regional security conference in June, Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe said: "If anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese military has no choice but to fight at all costs for national unity." In some shops in mainland China, you can buy postcards and T-shirts emblazoned with patriotic emblems promoting the retaking of Taiwan.
But for seven decades, China has resisted attacking Taiwan partly for political reasons, including the prospect of a US intervention and the potential heavy human toll. But the practical realities of a full-blown invasion are also daunting for the PLA, according to experts.

Ferrying hundreds of thousands of troops across the narrow Taiwan Strait to a handful of reliable landing beaches, in the face of fierce resistance, is a harrowing prospect. Troops would then have a long slog over Taiwan's western mudflats and mountains to reach the capital, Taipei.
Not only that, but China would face an opponent who has been preparing for war for almost 70 years.
At mass anti-invasion drills in May, Taiwan military spokesman Maj. Gen. Chen Chung-Chi said the island knew it had to always be "combat-ready."
"Of course, we don't want war, but only by gaining our own strength can we defend ourselves," he said. "If China wants to take any action against us, it has to consider paying a painful price."

Difficult and bloody
It could be easy to assume that any invasion of Taiwan by Beijing would be brief and devastating for Taipei: a David and Goliath fight between a tiny island and the mainland's military might, population and wealth.
With nearly 1.4 billion people, the People's Republic of China has the largest population in the world. Taiwan has fewer than 24 million people -- a similar number to Australia. China has the fifth largest territory in the world, while Taiwan is the size of Denmark or the US state of Maryland. And Beijing runs an economy that is second only to the United States, while Taiwan's doesn't rank in the world's top 20.
But perhaps most pertinently, China has been building and modernizing its military at an unprecedented rate, while Taiwan relies on moderate US arms sales.

In sheer size, the PLA simply dwarfs Taiwan's military.
China has an estimated 1 million troops, almost 6,000 tanks, 1,500 fighter jets and 33 navy destroyers, according to the latest US Defense Department report. Taiwan's ground force troops barely number 150,000 and are backed by 800 tanks and about 350 fighter aircraft, the report found, while its navy fields only four destroyer-class ships.
Under Chinese President Xi Jinping, the PLA has rapidly modernized, buoyed by rises in military spending and crackdowns on corruption in the army's leadership.
"China's leaders hope that possessing these military capabilities will deter pro-independence moves by Taiwan or, should deterrence fail, will permit a range of tailored military options against Taiwan and potential third-party military intervention," according to a 2019 US Defense Intelligence Agency report on China's military.
Yet while China hawks in the media might beat the drum of invasion, an internal China military study, seen by CNN, revealed that the PLA considers an invasion of Taiwan to be extremely difficult.
"Taiwan has a professional military, with a strong core of American-trained experts," said Ian Easton, author of "The Chinese Invasion Threat" and research fellow at the Project 2049 Institute, as well as "highly defensible" terrain.
In his book he described an invasion by China as "the most difficult and bloody mission facing the Chinese military."

The plan to take Taiwan
China's Taiwan invasion plan, known internally as the "Joint Island Attack Campaign," would begin with a mass, coordinated bombing of Taiwan's vital infrastructure -- ports and airfields -- to cripple the island's military ahead of an amphibious invasion, according to both Easton and Sidharth Kaushal, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies.
At the same time, the Chinese air force would fly over the Taiwan Strait and try to dominate the island's air space. Once the PLA was satisfied it had suitably disabled Taiwan's air and naval forces, Kaushal said soldiers would begin to invade on the west coast of the island.
The island's rocky, mountainous east coast is considered too inhospitable and far from mainland China.
The amphibious invasion needed to put troops on Taiwan, however, could be the biggest hurdle facing the PLA.
In its 2019 report to Congress, the US Department of Defense said China -- which has one of the largest navies in Asia -- had at its command 37 amphibious transport docks and 22 smaller landing ships, as well as any civilian vessels Beijing could enlist.
That might be enough to occupy smaller islands, such as those in the South China Sea, but an amphibious assault on Taiwan would likely require a bigger arsenal -- and there is "no indication China is significantly expanding its landing ship force," the report said.

That makes it vital for Beijing to neutralize Taiwan's navy and air force in the early stages of an attack, Kaushal said.
"The Taiwanese air force would have to sink around 40% of the amphibious landing forces of the PLA in order to render this sort of mission infeasible," he said.
Essentially, that's only about 10 to 15 ships, he added.
If they did make it across the strait, the PLA would still need to find a decent landing spot for its ships.
China's military would be looking for a landing site both close to the mainland, and a strategic city, such as Taipei, with nearby port and airport facilities.
That leaves just 14 potential beaches, Easton said -- and it's not only the PLA that knows it. Taiwanese engineers have spent decades digging tunnels and bunkers in potential landing zones along the coast.

Furthermore, the backbone of Taiwan's defense is a fleet of vessels capable of launching anti-ship cruise missiles, on top of an array of ground-based missiles, and substantial mines and artillery on the coastline.
"Taiwan's entire national defense strategy, including its war plans, are specifically targeted at defeating a PLA invasion," Easton said.
Chinese troops could be dropped in from the air, but a lack of paratroopers in the PLA makes it unlikely.
If the PLA held a position on Taiwan, and could reinforce with troops from the mainland to face off about 150,000 Taiwan troops, as well as more than 2.5 million reservists, it would have to push through the island's western mud flats and mountains, with only narrow roads to assist them, towards Taipei.
Finally, the mobilization of amphibious landing vessels, ballistic missile launchers, fighters and bombers, as well as hundreds of thousands of troops, would give Taiwan plenty of advance warning of any attack, Kaushal said.
"It's extremely unlikely that the invasion could come as a bolt from the blue," Kaushal added.

'The bad guy in the neighborhood'
There is, of course, one final deterrent to any PLA invasion of Taiwan.
It isn't clear whether or not such an attack by China would spark an intervention by the United States on Taipei's behalf.
Washington has been a longtime ally of the island, selling weapons to the Taiwan government and providing implicit military protection from Beijing.
Facing an aggressive Beijing, Taiwan's president issues a warning to the world
Easton said that, at present, the US would likely intervene in Taiwan's favor, both to protect investment by US companies on the island and reassure American allies in the region, who are also facing down a resurgent PLA in the East and South China seas.
Collin Koh Swee Lean, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies' Maritime Security Program in Singapore, said there would also be "immense political consequences" from taking over Taiwan, in the event of a successful China invasion.
"It will likely mean that China will be seen as the bad guy in the neighborhood, who uses force," he said. "It will alienate some regional partners and the good will which China has been trying to build over the years will evaporate. And it will set China on a collision course with the US."
But Taipei isn't taking anything for granted.
On the sidelines of the massive Han Guang drills, Taiwan's Maj. Gen. Chen pointed out the hundreds of spectators who had come out to watch and support the island's military.
"These exercises let people know the national army of the Republic of China is ready," he said.
Taiwan is taking no chances. South China Sea: Satellite image shows Chinese fighter jets deployed to contested island Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center, said the deployment is designed to "demonstrate it is their territory and they can put military aircraft there whenever they want."
"It also makes a statement that they can extend their air power reach over the South China Sea as required or desired," Schuster said.
The J-10 jets have a combat range of about 500 miles (740 kilometers), putting much of the South China Sea and vital shipping lands within reach, Schuster said.
The four planes are not carrying external fuel tanks, the analysts said. That suggests they were to be refueled on the island, so the plan may be to keep them there awhile.

"It could be an early training deployment as part of getting the J-10 squadron operationally ready for an ADIZ (air defense identification zone) declaration," Layton said. "This activity may be the new normal."
China said in 2016 it reserved the right to impose an ADIZ over the South China Sea, which would require aircraft flying over the waters to first notify Beijing. It set up an ADIZ over the East China Sea in 2013, prompting an outcry from Japan and the United States, but the zone has not been fully enforced.

The Paracels sit in the north-central portion of the 1.3 million-square-mile South China Sea. They are also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan, but have been occupied by China since 1974, when Chinese troops ousted a South Vietnamese garrison.
The past several years have seen Beijing substantially upgrade its facilities on the islands, deploying surface-to-air missiles, building 20 hangars at the airfield, upgrading two harbors and performing substantial land reclamation, according to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative.
Woody Island has served as a blueprint for Beijing's more prominent island-building efforts in the Spratly chain to the south, AMTI said in a 2017 report.

The appearance of the J-10s on Woody Island comes just over a year after China sent its H-6K long-range bombers to the island for test flights for the first time.
The PLA claimed that mission was a part of China's aim to achieve a broader regional reach, quicker mobilization, and greater strike capabilities.
"The islands in the South China Sea are China's territory," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said after the bomber flights. "The relevant military activities are normal trainings and other parties shouldn't over-interpret them."
A military expert, Wang Mingliang, was quoted in a Chinese statement as saying the training would hone the Chinese air force's war-preparation skills and its ability to respond to various security threats in the region.
In 2017, a report in China's state-run Global Times, said fighter jets -- J-11s -- were deployed to Woody Island for the first time, with the new hangars able to protect the warplanes from the island's high heat and humidity.
That report said such hangars would be useful on other Chinese islands to greatly enhance Beijing's control over the South China Sea. Fact-checking Trump's ABC interview Facts First: Trump is rewriting history. The Veterans Choice Program was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2014 and was co-sponsored by Senator John McCain. Trump signed a bill to continue the program and eventually consolidated other programs under the new Veterans Community Care Program.
Veterans Choice aimed to expand veteran's access to health care by increasing the number of medical staff in the VA system as well as allowing those who met certain criteria (either from wait time or distance to a VA facility) to see doctors outside of the VA system.
The bill signed by Trump in June of 2018, the VA MISSION Act, will consolidate several different VA health programs into the new Veterans Community Care Program. The program was set to start this summer, and for the year between the VA MISSION Act provided $5.2 billion to continue the Veterans Choice Program. The bill also expanded veteran's ability to take their VA benefits to private doctors.
Tariffs
When Stephanopoulos asserted that Americans are paying for the tariffs on China, Trump retorted "No, they're not."
"China subsidizes their product in order to keep people working," Trump said before going on to argue that many companies were also moving out of China in order to avoid the tariffs. "So there is no tariff."
Facts First: Trump is flatly wrong on this notion. US consumers and companies pay a large chunk of the tariffs Trump has placed on China. In addition, while there is evidence that US importers are shifting part of their production outside China, there isn't much to suggest there's a mass exodus of companies relocating away from China.
Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that 40% of the cost of tariffs has been passed on to consumers, with producers and retailers taking on the rest.
According to a study from economists at Princeton, Columbia and the New York Federal Reserve, by the end of 2018 US companies and consumers were paying $3 billion a month more, plus $1.4 billion in additional losses, because of these new tariffs, mostly on China.
In their Economic Report published in March, Trump's own administration admitted that despite any "benefits" which the tariffs may have are offset by the "costs paid by consumers in the form of higher prices and reduced consumption." So yes, Americans are paying these tariffs.
As for Trump's claim that companies are fleeing China to avoid paying tariffs, it's difficult to measure how prevalent that trend is. Or if it's even happening at all.
US imports from countries outside of China have increased in the first four months of 2019 compared to last year: 22% from Taiwan, 17% from South Korea, 38% from Vietnam, and 13% from Bangladesh. But part of this increase could be part of an already upward trend of importing more from countries outside of China and from the strong US economy, which leads to higher imports overall.
US Census Bureau trade data published this month noted that US importers are taking in 12% less from China this year. While this is a significant number it's difficult to argue that "many" companies are moving out of China. Additionally, there are a large number of products made exclusively in China due to the interdependence of global supply chains.
As Facts First has previously noted, for example, many raw materials integral to the US chemical industry now fall under Trump's tariffs and are "unavailable outside of China," Jennifer Abril, president of the Society of Chemical Manufacturers & Affiliates told CNN in May.
Clinton colluded
Stephanopoulos pressed Trump on the most damning portions of the Mueller report, including the dozens of contacts between Trump's team and Russians. The report said numerous Trump associates were drawn into the Russian web and took meetings with Kremlin-tied figures who offered dirt on Hillary Clinton, but they did not cross the line into a criminal conspiracy.
In his answer, Trump ignored these findings and attacked his 2016 opponent.
"What about Hillary Clinton?" Trump asked. "Hillary Clinton conspired with Russia. She had somebody that came out of Russia. They got information from Russia. Excuse me. Hillary Clinton was totally involved with it. If you talk about collusion with Russia take a look at Christopher Steele, all his contacts with Russia which by the way she paid for, and turned out to be a phony deal, which everyone is now admitting that. No George, all I want is the truth."
Facts First: Trump is lying about Clinton by making up allegations that she colluded with the Russians in 2016. He's also twisting the facts about the Steele dossier, and is creating a false equivalency between his team's contacts with Russians and Clinton's ties to the dossier.
For starters, there is absolutely no evidence that "Clinton conspired with Russia" like Trump claimed. Mueller's mandate was to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election and whether any Americans - not just Trump aides -- were involved in those efforts.
The report said nothing about connections between the Clinton campaign and the Russian government or the Internet Research Agency, the Kremlin-connected troll farm that spread propaganda to US audiences.
Trump then turned to the infamous Steele dossier, the series of private intelligence memos that former British spy Christopher Steele wrote in the final months of the 2016 campaign.
The memos contained details about Russian meddling that pre-dated public announcements about Russia's activities by the US government. They also alleged that Trump colluded with the Kremlin. Some claims have been debunked, while others have held up over time; some remain unproven while others are partially true. Trump is wrong when he says it was all "phony."
One of the main claims in the Steele dossier -- that the Trump campaign engaged in a widespread conspiracy of collusion with the Russians -- was not established by Mueller.
But the President is wrong that Steele is "somebody that came out of Russia." Steele is a British citizen. He lived in Russia as an undercover spy, but his allegiance was to the United Kingdom. The UK is one of America's closest allies for intelligence-sharing. Steele's strong track record made him a trusted and valuable informant for the FBI and other US government agencies.
Trump is also wrong that Clinton "was totally involved" in the Steele dossier. There is no evidence that she was directly involved, and her campaign chairman testified to Congress that he didn't know about it before the 2016 election. But Clinton's campaign funded Steele's work. They paid a law firm, which hired an opposition research company, which brought on Steele.
On Monday morning, Clinton tweeted a response to Trump's claims she colluded with Russia, calling them "outlandish."
Rebuffing Russian outreach
Trump mischaracterized a key finding from the Mueller report. He claimed: "Mueller said that we rebuffed Russia, that we pushed them away, that we weren't interested. Read the report."
Facts First: This is only half the story, and it is a very misleading representation of the Mueller report. Trump omitted the part where Mueller said that some members of Trump's campaign eagerly accepted meetings with Russians and even solicited their help on the 2016 election.
Here's what the Mueller report said about this: "In sum, the investigation established multiple links between Trump Campaign officials and individuals tied to the Russian government. Those links included Russian offers of assistance to the Campaign. In some instances, the Campaign was receptive to the offer, while in other instances the Campaign officials shied away."
This isn't the first time Trump made this misleading claim. The whole truth is much more nuanced. Sometimes the Russians were rebuffed, sometimes they were welcomed. Trump's own son, Donald Trump Jr., eagerly took a meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016 after being told that she was bringing damaging information about Clinton on behalf of the Kremlin.
Ultimately, the investigation did not establish that any of these contacts broke the law.
Cooperation with Mueller
Defending his response to the Mueller investigation, Trump said he was "the most transparent in history" and touted the fact that he provided Mueller with 1.5 million pages of documents. He also said "I gave them four or five hundred witnesses" to be interviewed by investigators.
Facts First: It's true that Trump gave Mueller's team broad access to interview White House officials and read their internal notes, which proved pivotal to the investigation. But that group represents only a small slice of the 500 witnesses Mueller interviewed. And perhaps most importantly, Trump refused multiple requests from investigators for a sit-down interview.
Whenever Trump touts his "transparency" with the Mueller investigation, he never mentions his adamant refusal to agree to a sit-down interview. While Trump made his aides available for interviews, he agreed only to answer written questions about collusion, but not obstruction. Mueller made it clear that Trump's responses were "incomplete" and generally insufficient.
There are many other reasons why Trump is not "the most transparent" president in US history, including his refusal to release his tax returns and his fight to block Congressional subpoenas to gain access to his financial statements.
Trump also exaggerated the number of witnesses he "gave" to Mueller so they could testify.
Mueller interviewed 500 witnesses, but Trump could only control the testimony of White House aides. More than two dozen Trump administration officials voluntarily gave interviews to the special counsel. The fruits of those interviews created the foundation of the obstruction inquiry.
Federal investigators interviewed hundreds of people Trump didn't have any control over. For example, Mueller's team spoke to Russian banker Petr Aven, conservative author and conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi, and the translator at the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting.
However, to Trump's credit, he did not invoke executive privilege or go to court to prevent Mueller's team from interviewing White House aides of reviewing their documents.
Trump says Putin helped Clinton
Trump claimed the Russians "were also helping the Clinton campaign," and later said Russian President Vladimir Putin "would much rather have Hillary Clinton be president right now."
Facts First: Trump is entitled to his own views. But he stands alone in his belief that the Russians tried to help Clinton's campaign in 2016. The US intelligence community announced after the 2016 election that the Kremlin tried to help Trump, a conclusion that has been endorsed by all of Trump's handpicked officials to lead the intelligence agencies.
The stunning assessment that the Russian government tried to help Trump was made public in a January 2017 report featured unanimous conclusions from the FBI, the CIA and the National Security Agency. The report was prepared during the Obama administration but Trump's appointees to lead these US intelligence agencies have endorsed the report and its findings.
This isn't about collusion or coordination with the campaign. It's about the wide-ranging Russian campaign to influence Americans, largely in Trump's favor. For instance, Facebook acknowledged that Russian propaganda reached 126 million Americans on its platform both before and after the election.
The Russians hacked Democratic targets and released their emails through WikiLeaks at pivotal moments in the campaign, including days before the Democratic National Convention and after the leak of the Access Hollywood tape that featured Trump making offensive comments about women. These hacks, carried out by Russian military officers, gave Trump a massive boost.
Trump on Russian 'bloggers'
On four occasions in his ABC interview, Trump used the word "bloggers" to describe Russian hackers.
"They also said that there were bloggers in Moscow," Trump said. "And they said specifically about the bloggers in Moscow, had nothing to do with Trump, had nothing to do with -- and there were like 32 or 36 bloggers. We have nothing to do with bloggers in Moscow."
Facts First: They weren't bloggers. They were sophisticated hackers who worked for the Russian military, according to court filings. Trump's language downplays the seriousness of their actions, which Mueller himself described as "a concerted attack on our political system."
According to dictionary definitions, a blogger is someone who writes for a blog, which is an online publication or personal website that typically features commentary on a specific topic.
The Russians hackers who meddled in the 2016 election were intelligence officers who worked for Russia's military intelligence agency, known as the GRU.
"Russian intelligence officers who were part of the Russian military launched a concerted attack on our political system," Mueller said in his only public statement about the investigation.
Trump's comments diminish the role of the Russian government in the attack. Interestingly, Putin has also sought to distance the Russian state from the hacks, saying that "patriotic hackers" might have meddled in American politics, but they were not directed by the Kremlin.
That's just not true, according to Mueller, whose office indicted a dozen GRU officers. They were accused of hacking Democratic targets in 2016 and sharing the spoils with WikiLeaks.
Debates
Stephanopoulos asked Trump how it was that several Republican senators who were initially skeptical of Trump eventually came around to support him. Trump pointed to the 2016 presidential debates and how, he said, "they found out I am very smart and I know what I'm doing."
"I had, what, 15 debates and we won every debate," said Trump. "According to every poll, I mean I can only tell you by the polls. But every poll, they had many polls, doing many debates, I never lost one poll, I think they've gained a certain respect."
Facts First: Trump did not, according to polling, win every debate he participated in during the 2016 presidential campaign.
In a Fox News poll on the first GOP presidential debate in August 2015, voters were asked who performed the best and worst during the debate. Fox News combined these scores, leaving Trump in last place with -13 points and Carly Fiorina in first with +12 points.
Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who watched one or both of the back-to-back debates in September 2015, Trump came in third, with 11%, behind Marco Rubio (14%) and Carly Fiorina (52%), when respondents were asked which candidate did the best job during the debates, according to a CNN poll.
During the December 2015 debate among GOP presidential hopefuls, Trump's luck changed. He came in first in a CNN poll, winning with 33% among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. (Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas came in second, behind by 5 points.)
In a CBS News poll on the GOP debate in February 2016, Trump came in second (24%), behind Rubio (32%), among Republicans and independents who were asked what candidate they thought did the best job.
Trump told Stephanopoulos that he won all 15 debates. Since there were 12 primary debates and three general debates, it would appear that Trump is also claiming that he won the three debates with Hillary Clinton.
When looking at the three debates between Trump and Clinton, Clinton won all three debates, among all those polled by CNN. Among Republicans, however, Trump won all three debates, gradually going up from 55% to 68% and 74%, whereas, among Democrats, Clinton consistently stayed around 90%.
Pre-existing conditions protections
When Stephanopoulos asked the President whether his drive to overturn Obamacare equates to abandoning those with preexisting conditions, Trump denied it.
"Preexisting conditions-- I was for preexisting conditions. And I still-- you know, I'm very much for preexisting conditions," he said.
Facts First: While Trump has continued to state his support for covering people with preexisting conditions, his administration is actively seeking to have Obamacare declared unconstitutional. This would eliminate the health care law's groundbreaking and very popular protections for those with less-than-perfect medical histories.
The administration is siding with Texas and a coalition of Republican-led states that are challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act in federal court.
The Department of Justice initially argued a year ago that two key Obamacare provisions were no longer valid because Congress effectively eliminated the individual mandate by reducing the penalty for not having insurance to $0.
Those two provisions -- which ban insurers from denying coverage and from setting premiums based on health backgrounds -- overhauled the nation's health insurance industry and allowed millions of Americans to gain coverage.
Under Attorney General William Barr, the department went even further in pushing to dismantle the law. In a filing with the federal appeals court in March, the Justice Department said it agreed with the December ruling of a federal judge in Texas that invalidated the entire Affordable Care Act. (The law remains in effect as the case works its way through the courts.)
If Obamacare itself falls, it would also eliminate the provision that requires insurers to provide comprehensive policies that cover a wide range of treatments, another key component of the protections for those with preexisting conditions.
A coalition of 21 blue states led by California is defending the law. The Democratic-led House of Representatives has joined the effort, painting the GOP as hurting those with preexisting conditions.
The two sides are expected to argue before a panel of appellate judges in early July.
Trump also said he's formulating a new GOP health care plan that will be better than Obamacare. But the bills that Congress came up with in 2017 in the Republicans' failed attempt to repeal and replace the law would have also chipped away at the protections for those with preexisting conditions.
The so-called "skinny repeal" bill that the late Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona helped to nix would have given states more flexibility in requiring insurers to provide comprehensive policies. The President continues to criticize McCain's famous thumbs-down vote on the bill in July 2017

Publicly, the Chinese government has struck a defiant tone on the protests, supporting the local government and blaming "foreign meddling" and anti-China elements inside the city.
But experts said the Hong Kong demonstrations drew attention to China at a time when Xi could least afford negative scrutiny.
"President Xi still wants to get the US trade talks back on track and he doesn't want to link trade with any other issue at this point," said Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).

Xi's authority 'dented'
A policy concession by a top Chinese official is rare to say the least, and for it to come as a result of public pressure is almost unheard of.
Nonetheless, that's what Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam did on Sunday when she apologized to Hong Kong residents after an estimated 2 million of them, about a quarter of the city's population, took to the streets.
A day earlier, the government had suspended the controversial bill that protesters said would have potentially put political activists and business people at risk of being extradited to mainland China -- and disappeared into the country's opaque criminal justice system.
Chief Executive Lam and her government have insisted the bill was simply a way to close loopholes and ensure Hong Kong does not become a haven for fugitives from the mainland.
Hong Kong extradition bill: Hundreds of thousands join third huge protest in a week
Instead, debate around the law appears to have revived Hong Kong's nascent protest movement at the worst possible time for Beijing, amid the US trade war and just months before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
"It implies that if people are brave enough to show defiance against Beijing, they can get away with it, they can get some results, they can force Beijing and the Chinese Communist Party to back down," said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and longtime analyst of Chinese politics.
Lam said Xi's authority, already "dented" by the prolonged US trade war, would be further questioned in Beijing in the wake of the Hong Kong protests. "This is one more set back for Xi Jinping," he said.

Hong Kong divides US and China
Hong Kong is an unwanted headache for the Chinese leader less than two weeks before he is due to meet world leaders at the G20 summit in Osaka.
Most importantly, though it has yet to be confirmed, Xi is also expected to meet face-to-face with US President Trump for the first time since trade talks collapsed at the beginning of May.
Both sides blamed the other for the failure and, in response, the Trump administration raised tariffs to 25% on an estimated $200 billion of Chinese goods.
Weakened by the trade war, Xi returns to security conference ready to woo Modi and Putin
The Chinese government maintains it is not afraid of a trade war, but higher tariffs are an extra burden on an economy that's already showing signs of slowing.
While both sides are trying to find a way forward, the Hong Kong protests have sparked another wave of antagonism and rhetoric between the US and China.
After the initial protests, Secretary of State Pompeo expressed concern about the proposed extradition bill, while the US Congress has threatened new legislation which would downgrade Hong Kong's special status as a trading hub if Beijing doesn't stop infringing on the city's freedoms.
That special status is significant. Hong Kong is allowed economic freedoms that are restricted to the rest of China, which, tied with an unbiased court system left over from the UK colonial period, have led to many large Western businesses basing their lucrative China operations out of the city.
As more US businesses begin to look at investments outside of China, Hong Kong's role as the country's most economically liberal city is more important than ever.
China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Friday that any attempts to instigate chaos in Hong Kong were bound to fail. "We urge certain people in the US to respect basic facts, discard arrogance and prejudice, stop playing dirty tricks that meddle in Hong Kong affairs," said spokesman Geng Shuang.
China expert Glaser said it wasn't unusual for Beijing to accuse the US of interfering in its domestic politics, a standard pattern which went back decades to the fall of the Soviet Union.
But she added it wasn't out of the question for President Trump to see Hong Kong as a potential point of leverage in trade talks, similar to his handling of Taiwan relations or the export ban on Huawei.
"There's always a risk that he chooses to use Hong Kong as a bargaining chip," she said.
'Over my dead body'
The Hong Kong protests have also come during a heated presidential election campaign in Taiwan, which has increasingly been seen as a referendum on relations with mainland China.
Taiwan and China have been separately governed since the end of a bloody civil war in 1949, and in the past decade Beijing has been attempting to woe the island back through a combination of promises and threats.
President Tsai Ing-wen's Democratic Progressive Party has historically been seen as pro-independence, while the opposition Kuomintang have encouraged closer relations with the mainland.
But in a sign that the Hong Kong protests are spreading, a leading opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate came out hard on Saturday against closer ties with the mainland.
"'One Country, Two Systems' can never be implemented in Taiwan. Taiwanese people can never accept it, unless it's over my dead body," presidential candidate Han Kuo-yu told a rally, referring to the special system of government used in Hong Kong.
In response, the crowd chanted "Reject 'One Country, Two Systems,"' according to Taiwan news agency CNA.
President Tsai herself has made regular statements in support of the Hong Kong protesters, clearly trying to burnish her anti-Beijing credentials ahead of the January vote.
"In their pursuit of democracy and freedom, the people of Hong Kong (are) not alone. Because we know that if you don't stand for something, you will fall for anything," the Taiwan leader said on her official Twitter feed on June 13.
China expert Lam said if the rebellious Hong Kong spirit spread to Taiwan, or even further, it would be dire news of Beijing.
"Xi has been trying to intimidate the people of Taiwan by naked demonstrations of force, but now the Taiwan people can point to Hong Kong to say that if the Taiwan people are united against China, they can get away with it," said Lam. "They can even force Beijing to make a compromise." Joshua Wong released from prison day after hundreds of thousands march in Hong Kong Wong added that he thought Beijing too must be looking at the chaos in Hong Kong -- amid the US-China trade war and other headaches for President Xi Jinping -- and wondering about Lam's future.
"Hong Kong is just a small international city with seven million citizens, but two million people came to the streets, it shows that we have the consensus," he said. "She has to end her political career."
Wong predicted that if the bill is not fully withdrawn and key officials resign, then protests could continue, particularly on July 1, the anniversary of the city's handover from British to Chinese rule and a key annual date for pro-democracy marches.
One of Wong's first actions Monday was to pay his respects at a memorial in Admiralty, near the main site of the protests, where a man fell to his death Saturday after climbing a shopping mall and displaying signs calling for the withdrawal of the extradition bill.

Wong's political party, Demosisto, has been among several youth groups -- all of which have their roots in the 2014 Umbrella Movement -- playing a big role in the protests against the extradition bill, which have been ongoing for weeks.
In a statement Saturday after Lam said she was suspending passage of the controversial bill. Demosisto said Hong Kongers should "demand that the bill be shelved for good, stand against political prosecution of protesters, condemn police brutality, and call for Lam's resignation."
"That Lam continues to blame the bill's widespread opposition as a result of Hong Kongers' misunderstanding of it is also condescending," Demosisto said Saturday. "Our movement may have won a battle, but the war is not yet over. We urge the international community not to turn away."
Wong appeared cognizant of that community in his statements Monday, speaking in Cantonese, English and Mandarin. He also thanked supporters in Taiwan, where the Hong Kong protests have become a major issue in the island's presidential election, creating yet another headache for Beijing.
Born in 1996, eight months before control of Hong Kong was handed over from the UK to China, Wong has spent most of his adolescence and all of his early adulthood fighting for the city's rights against what he and others say is increasing encroachment by Beijing.
A student leader during 2014's Occupy protests -- which called for universal suffrage in Hong Kong -- Wong became something of an international figurehead for the movement, and even appeared on the cover of Time magazine. His role in the protests later became the subject of the 2017 Netflix documentary, "Teenager vs. Superpower." Why Nintendo, Google and others may want to move some manufacturing out of China Video game consoles are typically a low-margin business, meaning that tariffs on consoles could be a real problem for Nintendo's ability to turn a profit. And Nintendo has been counting on the Switch console to drive big sales.
A spokesperson for Nintendo did not confirm or deny that it would be shifting manufacturing away from China.
"Most of the components that make up the Nintendo Switch console are manufactured in China," the spokesperson said. "To help keep costs down for consumers, it helps logistically to assemble products in close proximity of where those parts are manufactured."

The Japanese company did, however, say it is closely following the tariff situation, and that it is "always exploring options" for where its products are produced.
Google (GOOGL) did not respond to a request for comment.
Trade war prompts manufacturing moves
Beyond Nintendo and Google, companies have been reconsidering their supply chains since the White House launched a trade war with China last year. Last month, the United States hiked import tariffs to 25% from 10% on $200 billion in Chinese goods including electronic equipment and computer products like produce and textiles.
Companies that rely on China for production of goods to be sent to the United States are also concerned about other potential Chinese retaliatory measures, such as increased regulations or customs delays. China has ramped up pressure on American companies as trade tensions escalate.
After the United States hit Huawei with an export ban on May 15, effectively barring American companies from doing business with the Chinese smartphone maker, China responded by creating a blacklist of foreign firms. Earlier this month, China fined Ford's main venture in the country for antitrust violations, fueling fears about tit-for-tat punitive actions by the two countries.
This uncertainty may be an even more compelling reason to move manufacturing than tariffs, said New York University Stern Business School professor Joseph Foudy.
"If we knew China was facing a 15% to 20% tariff, some companies might just chalk that up to a business expense and stay," Foudy said. "It's the uncertainty that drives you to look abroad because you can't put a price on that."
For tech companies in particular, concerns about intellectual property and security have also been points of contention for the US-China relationship and may put pressure on them to diversify their sourcing and manufacturing networks.
Diversifying production
Much of the production work moving out of China has shifted to countries in Southeast Asia — not to the United States. The manufacturing sector in the region this month experienced its strongest growth rate in nine months, according to the most recent Nikkei-Markit purchasing manufacturers index, thanks in large part to new orders.
Rising wages in China have given companies yet another reason to consider moving production to Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam and Thailand where labor is cheaper. The increasing automation of tech manufacturing makes that easier, as companies no longer have to rely so heavily on highly skilled workers to produce their goods.
Much of the production of Google motherboards bound for the United States has already moved to Taiwan, according to the Bloomberg report. Over the past year, Google has also invested in its Taiwan engineering and innovation hub, with plans to expand its campus and double the size of its team in New Taipei City, as well as providing artificial intelligence and digital marketing training to local students.

Despite these shifts, China, the world's largest manufacturer, remains a vitally important production hub. Not only are factories and suppliers centered there but the infrastructure — roads, ports, airports and power grids — remain better than in many of those countries where production has begun to move.
Although companies may gradually move some manufacturing or expand their production networks beyond China, Foudy said he doesn't expect the country's dominance as a manufacturing center will experience any major changes.
"China remains the 'total package' of manufacturing," Foudy said. "The efficiency of manufacturing is based on how many suppliers are located nearby, what the quality of roads and ports and infrastructure is like, the quality and consistency of electricity, and the talent pool to draw on. On all of those metrics, China remains number one."
US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet at the Group of 20 summit at the end of this month. Trump has threatened to place tariffs on another $300 billion of Chinese exports if China's leader does not attend the meeting. If the negotiations don't end well, companies might more seriously consider moving production out of China. Trump says he hopes China and Hong Kong can work things out in wake of protests "I looked today and that really is a million people. A lot of times people talk about, they had 2,000 people but it was really 1,000 or it was 200. I see it all the time," he said. "But when you look at this demonstration, they said it was a million people. That was a million people."
Wednesday's protests come three days after a mostly peaceful march in central Hong Kong. Police estimated 240,000 people attended on Sunday, while organizers put the number at 1.03 million -- the latter figure would make it the city's largest protest since the former British colony was handed back to China in 1997.
Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters in Hong Kong on Wednesday, hours after tens of thousands of mostly young people surrounded the city's government headquarters and postponed the debate over the controversial bill.
As violent clashes erupted between protesters and the authorities late Wednesday afternoon local time, Hong Kong Police Commissioner Steven Lo Wai-chung said the demonstration was being considered a "riot."
He added that police had been left with "no choice but to start to use force."
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it has separate laws that follow the UK system and no capital punishment, unlike mainland China. Many people fear that the proposed extradition law means they could be taken from Hong Kong by Chinese authorities for political or inadvertent business offenses.

Hong Kong and China: One country, two systems 02:12
Trump's statement hoping for a resolution between Hong Kong and mainland China comes ahead of a planned meeting between the President and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 in Japan later this month. The two are expected to continue trade talks, but White House adviser Kellyanne Conway suggested the extradition bill may come up.
"Obviously, we want people to live in peace and prosperity and we're -- pretty remarkable to see that many people taking to the streets. When the President meets with President Xi perhaps that will be raised," Conway told reporters Wednesday morning.
State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus encouraged "all sides to exercise restraint and to refrain from violence."
"Of course we think these peaceful protests are incredibly important and it's important for the Hong Kong government to respect these freedom of expressions, respect the right to peacefully assemble," she said during a press briefing Wednesday. Trump's trade war is here to stay. Companies like mine will pay the price To be fair to President Trump, a reckoning with China over its trade practices, including allegedly stealing trade secrets and forced technology sharing, has been a long time coming, and, if not under Trump, would ultimately have come to a head under a future administration.
Reducing America's overreliance on Chinese imports will be healthy in the long run. Lowering the trade deficit with China will give Washington greater leverage in future negotiations over strategic economic and geopolitical matters. But it will be painful for American companies and consumers in the near term.

Where Trump went wrong in the US-China trade war
The US-China trade war hurts American families
Diversification is already happening, according to a new report from New York Federal Reserve economists. An 8% year-on-year growth rate in Chinese imports in October flipped to an 18% decline in March — before Trump hiked the tariff rate to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese goods in early May. China's export orders were down in May compared to the previous month, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics.
China's Southeast Asia neighbors are mainly picking up the slack and reaping the benefits. According to recent Census Bureau data, US imports from Taiwan rose to 22% in the first four months of 2019, while imports from Vietnam are up 38%. First-quarter imports from South Korea meanwhile rose by 17%.
At Canary, we plan to operate as if the tariffs on Chinese goods are here to stay. China's government recently released a white paper on the trade standoff that makes it clear Beijing is not giving in to US demands anytime soon.
We have moved much of our manufacturing to Vietnam, India, Malaysia and South Korea. We still depend on China for a significant portion of the wellheads and other steel products used in the oilfields, but it's on the decline. Our goal is for non-Chinese sources to account for 25% of our international purchases within the year, up from our previous target of 10%.
Like other US companies, we recognize that doing business with these rival suppliers can be more expensive than with our traditional Chinese partners. But over time, with markets braced for a protracted US-China trade war, that may not be the case as manufacturers in nations that are not in Trump's crosshairs expand their capabilities. For now, the smart move is to build strong business relationships in countries that Washington has far fewer gripes with than Beijing. US and Russian warships nearly collide in the Pacific This latest incident comes just days after the US Navy accused Russia of intercepting a US aircraft and amid tensions with Moscow on a wide range of geopolitical issues.
Last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met Russian Vladimir Putin in the resort town of Sochi, where he warned Russia about interfering in US elections, taking a tougher public line than President Donald Trump on the issue.
It also comes at a time of increasing cooperation between China and Russia. After a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Kremlin Wednesday, Russian leader Vladimir Putin said relations between the two countries have reached an "unprecedented level."
Russia's geopolitical views align with those of China on many international and regional issues, Putin added.
Both leaders agreed that there is no alternative to a peaceful solution on the Korean Peninsula. They discussed joint efforts to resolve the crisis in Syria and attempts to stabilize the situation in Venezuela, he said.
Xi called the Russian President "a friend," and reiterated Putin's view, saying that "our cooperation is based on mutual trust."
Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan told reporters Friday that he is concerned about the safety of sailors following the "unsafe and unprofessional" incident and said the US will engage the Russians in "military to military" talks to convey a formal diplomatic message of concern, known as a démarche, to Moscow.
"We'll have military to military conversations with the Russians and of course we'll démarche them. To me its safety that is most important. It will not deter us when conducting our operations," he said before greeting Greek Minister of National Defence Evangelos Apostolakis to the Pentagon.
'Unsafe and unprofessional'
The US guided-missile cruiser was traveling in a straight line and trying to recover its helicopter when the incident occurred, he said.
"We consider Russia's actions during this interaction as unsafe and unprofessional," Doss said.
CNN obtained the video and picture of the event after a US official told CNN earlier that the Navy was working to declassify images to dispute the Russian narrative that the US was at fault.
Two navy officials tell CNN the Russian wake in the photo could only come from a steep turn that has to be executed at high speed.
{"@context": "http://schema.org","@type": "ImageObject","url": "//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190607073240-us-navy-russia-destroyer-incident-large-169.jpg",}
"The wakes suggest the Russian ship didn't adhere to either the rules of the road or the incidents at sea agreement," according to Carl Schuster, a retired US Navy captain and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center.
International maritime law requires ships to maintain a safe distance, normally interpreted as 1,000 yards, when passing another. It also requires navies not to interfere with another ship conducting flight operations, he said.
The US account was contradicted by Russia's Pacific Fleet, which claimed it was the US ship that instigated the incident, according to comments carried by the state-run RIA-Novosti news agency.
"When moving (on) parallel courses of a detachment of ships of the Pacific Fleet and a carrier group of the US Navy, the cruiser Chancellorsville suddenly changed its direction and crossed within 50 meters of the Admiral Vinogradov," forcing the Russian destroyer to take emergency evasive action, the RIA-Novosti report said.
The US Navy said the incident occurred in the Philippine Sea while the Russian report said it happened in the East China Sea. The boundary between the two bodies of water is the Senakaku Islands (also known as the Diaoyu islands in China), to the south of Japan and east of Taiwan.

","url": "//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190607063317-russian-destroyer-admiral-vinogradov-file-restricted-large-169.jpg",}
Regardless, the incident occurred in international waters and unusually far away from Russia, Schuster said.
"The Russians normally harass our ships when they are operating in waters the Russian consider to be within their sphere of Influence (Black Sea, Barents Sea and the waters off Vladivostok," said Schuster, who spent 12 years at sea on US warships.
Sending a message?
Retired rear admiral and CNN military analyst John Kirby added that the timing of the encounter is also noteworthy as it coincides with Xi's visit to Moscow.
"Clearly this sends a strong message to President Xi, from Putin's perspective, that we are on your team," Kirby told CNN's Jim Sciutto.
"We have seen the Russians and Chinese cooperate increasingly ... when it suits their interests," he said, adding that the two countries participated in a major military exercise together just last year.
But at the end of the day, both Kirby and Schuster said that Friday's incident was primarily about sending a message to the US.
"Putin clearly has ordered the Russian Navy to pressure the USN whenever opportunities exist. It may possibly be a show of political support for China while Xi is in Moscow, but more likely to signal that Russia is willing to challenge the US dominance on the world stage and at sea," Schuster said.
On Tuesday, the US accused Russia of intercepting a US aircraft flying in international airspace over the Mediterranean Sea three times in just under three hours.
Russia intercepts US aircraft flying over the Mediterranean Sea
The second of the three interactions "was determined to be unsafe" due to the Russian aircraft "conducting a high speed pass directly in front of the mission aircraft, which put our pilots and crew at risk," the US Navy said.
The Russian aircraft was armed and passed about 150 feet directly in front of the US plane, according to two US officials.
The Russian military disputed the US Navy's characterization of the intercept as unsafe.
"All flights of Russian aircraft were carried out in accordance with the international rules for the use of airspace," the Russian Ministry of Defense told reporters Wednesday. "There were no questions or complaints from the American center of flight deconfliction line in Syria to the Russian command."
Still, US officials argue that Friday's incident in the Philippine Sea and Tuesday's encounter over the Mediterranean Sea are evidence of a larger pattern of Russian misbehavior.
"The behavior by the Captain of the Russian destroyer in the Philippine Sea was irresponsible and reckless. This unwise maneuver, combined with the unsafe maneuvers by the Russian aircraft in the eastern Mediterranean earlier this week, make it clear that these dangerous actions by Russian military forces across the globe do not match what the world expects from a responsible and trustworthy world power," Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson said Friday in a tweet.
"The US Navy will not be deterred from supporting the free and open use of the seas and skies where international law clearly allows all to operate," he added. US imports from Vietnam and other countries rise amid China trade war The President has repeatedly claimed that his tariffs will prompt manufacturers to bring production back to the US, a core campaign promise.
"The higher the Tariffs go, the higher the number of companies that will move back to the USA!," he tweeted this week.
Yet he's also acknowledged that his trade wars are driving manufacturing elsewhere -- which dings China but doesn't do much for American consumers.
"Also, the Tariffs can be completely avoided if you buy from a non-Tariffed Country, or you buy the product inside the USA (the best idea). That's Zero Tariffs. Many Tariffed companies will be leaving China for Vietnam and other such countries in Asia. That's why China wants to make a deal so badly!" Trump tweeted last month.
Many US importers, including those that sell hats, footwear and other apparel, rely heavily on China for those goods and component pieces. In some cases, the US doesn't have the factories to produce what's needed. Plus, wages are higher and the US labor market is tight.
"There is a litany of countries that footwear companies will consider before coming to the United States," said Matt Priest, president and CEO of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, adding, "The United States is really not an option."
But other countries are. Footwear companies will likely first look to shift production to Vietnam, where some shoe manufacturing already exists and it's easy to bring Chinese materials across the border, Priest said.
"I think this notion that everything has to be made here is ignoring the economic facts of the 21st century global supply chain," he said.
Even before Trump began imposing tariffs, some production was moving out of China because of increasing wages there. US imports from countries like Vietnam and South Korea have been steadily increasing over the past decade.
"The current trade dispute is certainly accelerating that trend," said Russell Price, the chief economist at Ameriprise Financial.
Trump has also inked a new trade deal with South Korea, opening up its market to US autos.
While Taiwan and South Korea are more focused on high-tech items like smartphones and semiconductors, places like Vietnam still offer competitive wages -- making it an attractive place to make apparel and shoes. World marks 30 years since Tiananmen massacre as China censors all mention Activists will hold a rally in Washington on Tuesday, with representatives of dozens of human rights groups, including Amnesty International, expected to attend, as well as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement Monday that the massacre still stirred the conscience "of freedom-loving people around the world."
"We salute the heroes of the Chinese people who bravely stood up 30 years ago in Tiananmen Square to demand their rights," he said, urging the Chinese government to make a "full, public accounting" of the incident.

The biggest event will take place in Hong Kong, the only place on Chinese soil where mass commemorations are held. A candlelit vigil has been held in Victoria Park every year since 1990, with hundreds of thousands attending during key anniversaries.
But across the border, the Chinese authorities will be watching attentively for any attempts to remember the massacre.
Tourists were visiting Tiananmen Square as usual on Tuesday, under the close watch of police and subject to frequent security checks.
On Monday, Chinese state-run newspaper Global Times said the massacre had been a "vaccination" against future "political turmoil" in the country, trumpeting China's economic progress in the decades since.
It wasn't the first Chinese comment on the anniversary. Speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on Sunday, Defense Minister Wei Fenghe said crushing the protests had been the "correct policy."

A day that changed China
For weeks in 1989, hundreds of thousands of students and workers gathered in Tiananmen Square, in the heart of the Chinese capital, to call for greater democracy as well as political and social reforms.
They faced down the tanks in Tiananmen Square. Now they want their children to forget it
At the height of the protests it seemed like they could be successful, forcing a government that was already pursuing economic reform to also accept limited political liberalization. But hardliners won an internal battle within the ruling Communist Party and a crackdown was ordered.
That decision changed China forever, ending hopes of a gradual move towards democracy. Today the Communist Party is stronger than ever, with President Xi Jinping recently throwing out term limits and clearing his way to serve for life.
Beijing has always defended the crackdown. Speaking at an international event Sunday, Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe described the Tiananmen protests as "political turmoil that the central government needed to quell."
"The government was decisive in stopping the turbulence, that was the correct policy," he said.

2019: China's year of sensitive anniversaries 03:53
The events of June 4 have been wiped from the history books in China and any discussion of the crackdown is strictly censored and controlled. Tiananmen is a prime target of the Great Firewall, China's sprawling online censorship apparatus.
Tuesday will be a major test of that system, which activists have spent years attempting to get past by using coded phrases such as "May 35" or "that year." But it's a test that it will likely pass with ease.
var id = '//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js'.replace(/\s+/g, '');!!document.getElementById(id) || (function makeEmbedScript(d, id) {var js,fjs;js = d.createElement('script');js.id = id;js.charset = 'utf-8';js.setAttribute('async', '');fjs = d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);js.src = '//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';}(document, id));
In the lead-up to June 4, internet users in China complained about difficulties accessing virtual private networks, a common method of bypassing the firewall, while posts on Chinese social media have been restricted or deleted as companies ramp up censorship during this sensitive period.
June 4 has been nicknamed "internet maintenance day" for the number of websites that go offline around the anniversary, their owners deciding that being dark is safer than accidentally publishing something which could provoke the ire of the authorities.
On Tuesday, CNN's website was blocked by the Great Firewall. While the move is not unprecedented, CNN was available to users in China ahead of the June 4 anniversary, as confirmed by GreatFire.org, an independent site which analyzes internet censorship in China.
The Cyberspace Administration of China, the government body which oversees internet regulation, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
var id = '//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js'.replace(/\s+/g, '');!!document.getElementById(id) || (function makeEmbedScript(d, id) {var js,fjs;js = d.createElement('script');js.id = id;js.charset = 'utf-8';js.setAttribute('async', '');fjs = d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);js.src = '//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';}(document, id));
Other international media organizations, including the New York Times and the BBC, have long been inaccessible to users inside China, according to GreatFire.org.
Speaking ahead of the anniversary, Mak Hoi-wah, chairman of the June 4 Museum in Hong Kong, said this type of mass censorship was damaging to the country.
"Without understanding the historical facts, we will not be able to move on," Mak said. "The Chinese government is trying to suppress it because they don't want their wrong deeds be remembered by the people." Rival South China Sea visions in spotlight as Washington, Beijing front Shangri-La Dialogue The Chinese Type 52D guided missile destroyer Guiyang participates in a naval parade on April 23, 2019.

William Choong, senior fellow at the Shangri-La Dialogue, said in a tweet Tuesday that the presence of both Wei and Shanahan would set up "a clash of two visions — the US/Japan-led 'free and open' Indo-Pacific and China's 'Asia for Asians.'"
Analyst Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center, told CNN: "Chinese leaders now recognize the value of multilateral defense venues and want to deny the US a monopoly of great power influence."
US intentions for the region have already been telegraphed strongly.
The Pentagon has stepped up freedom-of-navigation operations to as often as weekly. And the commander of the US Pacific Air Forces said this month that Air Force jets were flying in and around the South China Sea almost daily.
Washington has also sent warships through the Taiwan Strait separating China from what it calls its renegade province several times this year.
One of Washington's Taiwan Strait operations included a US Coast Guard cutter, which later sailed into the South China Sea — sending the fifth arm of its military and its main maritime law enforcement agency into the Pacific fray.
More robust US armament packages also seem to be part of the plan. For bilateral exercises with the Philippines in April, the US loaded the amphibious assault ship USS Wasp with 10 F-35B stealth fighters — four more than it normally carries — and sailed it into the South China Sea.
The amphibious assault ship USS Wasp transits the waters of the South China Sea with a large load of F-35 fighters.

Of course, it's not just the US that's active around the region. Its allies and partners are also involved.
France sent a ship through the Taiwan Strait this year, and is showing off its Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier on the sidelines of the conference. In May alone, Japanese, Indian, Philippine and US ships took part in a multilateral South China Sea exercise — while conference host Singapore held live-fire drills with India. A four-ship Australian naval force also visited countries around the region in a three-month trip that ended this week.
Meanwhile, US officials have bigger plans for the coming year.
In a conference call with reporters this month, US chief of naval operations Adm. John Richardson reiterated plans for the forward deployment of two littoral combat ships — fast, maneuverable warships designed for shallow-water operations — to Singapore this year. The ships would be the US Navy assets stationed closest to the South China Sea.
And in March, the commander of US Army forces in the Pacific, Gen. Robert Brown, announced plans to train 10,000 US troops for combat in "a South China Sea scenario." The Philippines and Thailand were mentioned as possible destinations for the troops.
The US pressure on Beijing extends back to Washington, where a bipartisan group of senators last week introduced legislation that would impose sanctions on Chinese companies and individuals who help the PLA's South China Sea build-up.

"China has been bully in both the South and East China Seas, encroaching on and intimidating its neighbors. Such aggressive behavior cannot go on unchecked," Sen. Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat, said in a statement.
For its part, China hasn't backed down at all: launching new warships, touting new weapons, keeping its forces active in the South China Sea — around Taiwan and beyond — and blasting Washington.
Beijing says it is the US that endangers peace in the region.
After the guided-missile destroyer USS Preble sailed near the Chinese-occupied Scarborough Shoal on May 20, the PLA website said: "The provocation of the US warship endangered the safety of ships, aircraft and personnel of both sides, undermined China's sovereignty and security, violated the basic norms governing international relations and sabotaged regional peace and stability."
It attributed the comment to Senior Col. Li Huamin, spokesman for the PLA's Southern Theater Command.
Li said Chinese ships and aircraft were sent to identify the US destroyer and warn it to leave Chinese-claimed territory.
China has no shortage of ships to conduct such surveillance, with the PLA Navy rapidly expanding.
What are China's naval goals? The West can't wait to find out
On May 12, it launched two Type-52D destroyers in a single day — the 19th and 20th of what are expected to be 30 ships in that class.
A US Defense Department report released in early May said China had Asia's largest navy, with more than 300 ships and submarines.
Military analyst Euan Graham, who was aboard an Australian warship during a recent South China Sea operation, said it and other Australian and US ships operating in the region were all closely monitored by the Chinese navy.
"The ubiquity of PLAN (PLA Navy) vessels shadowing other warships in the (South China Sea) suggests that China's surface force has grown big enough to be able to 'close-mark' at will," Graham wrote on The Strategist blog.
Meanwhile, the PLA Navy has held training exercises with Russia off China's east coast and with Thailand to the south.
To the north, Chinese air force jets in April conducted what Taiwan said was their most "provocative" mission in years in the Taiwan Strait, crossing the median line between the island and the mainland.

China on US Navy operation: We have missiles 03:03
"It was an intentional, reckless and provocative action. We've informed regional partners and condemn China for such behavior," Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.
But it's clear Taiwan can't expect much quarter from China.
A May report on the PLA's English-language website touted a new amphibious assault vehicle as "the world's most advanced." With its help, combined with other weapons in China's arsenal, "the People's Liberation Army is well positioned to deal with Taiwan secessionists and potential island disputes."
The Shangri-La Dialogue touts itself as a venue "where ministers debate the region's most pressing security challenges, engage in important bilateral talks and come up with fresh solutions together."
But against that backdrop of bluster and build-up, it's hard to expect any compromises to emerge from what Wei and Shanahan have to say. SARS Fast Facts Timeline:

November 16, 2002 - What will become known as SARS is first reported in Foshan, China.
November 2002-February 2003 - Five people die and more than 300 are reported ill of SARS in Guangdong province, China.
February 15-22, 2003 - Liu Jianlun develops SARS symptoms on a trip from Huang Xingchu in the Guangdong province to visit family in Hong Kong. He is considered patient zero, or the first person to die of the disease. He infects people at his hotel and his family. He is hospitalized and dies, as does one member of his family.
March 15, 2003 - The World Health Organization (WHO) issues an emergency travel advisory about the illness, calling it a "global threat."
March 27, 2003 - Hong Kong officials have quarantined more than 1,000 people and schools close in Singapore.
March 29, 2003 - Dr. Carlo Urbani, the WHO physician who identified SARS in patient zero, dies from the virus in Bangkok.
April 1, 2003 - An American Airlines flight from Tokyo is quarantined at Mineta San Jose Airport. Three passengers are transported to an area hospital for evaluation of SARS and later released.
April 4, 2003 - By executive order, President George W. Bush has SARS added to the list of communicable diseases for which a person can be quarantined.
April 14, 2003 - Working independently, American and Canadian scientists announce they have sequenced the genome thought to be the cause of SARS.
April 20, 2003 - China cancels a weeklong national holiday celebration as Beijing's SARS cases rise from 37 to 339 in less than a week. A wholesale vegetable market in Singapore closes and all 2,400 people are quarantined.
April 22, 2003 - The CDC issues a health alert for travelers in Toronto.
April 23, 2003 - Travel warnings and advisories for Shangxi province, Beijing and Toronto have been increased and those for Hong Kong and Guangdong province have been extended.

December 17, 2003 - Taiwanese Department of Health reports a case of SARS.
January 5, 2004 - Civet cats are linked through genetic testing to the outbreak of SARS, and the Chinese Health Ministry orders the killing of thousands of the mammals. A man in Guangdong province in China has a confirmed case of SARS
April 23, 2004 - The Chinese Health Ministry reports two confirmed cases of SARS, one in the eastern province of Anhui and the other in the capital, Beijing. Two other possible cases are being investigated.
April 25, 2004 - The Chinese Health Ministry identifies two new cases of SARS in Beijing.

October 5, 2012 - The CDC's Select Agent Program declares SARS to be a select agent, "a bacterium, virus or toxin that has the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety."
December 2017 - Chinese researchers locate a population of bats in a Yunnan province cave infected with SARS-related coronaviruses. The newly-discovered strains contain the genetic building blocks of the strain that triggered the SARS outbreak. China accuses US of 'economic terrorism' as trade war tensions escalate The warning came as China's top economic planning agency suggested it would be willing curb exports of rare earth minerals, which are crucial for high-tech manufacturing.
On May 15, the Trump administration signed an order that potentially banned major Chinese companies, such as technology giant Huawei, from buying vital components such as computer chips from the US.
Many of those chips are made using rare earths, of which China is a major exporter.

"At present, the United States completely overestimates its ability to control the global supply chain and is due to slap itself in the face when it sobers up from its happy, ignorant self-indulgence," said the commentary published under the pseudonym Wuyuehe. "Don't say we didn't warn you."
The phrase has, in the past, been reserved by the Chinese state media for times of serious conflict.
The People's Daily used it in 1962 before going into armed conflict against India and again in 1978 before the Vietnam invasion. More recently, though it has appeared in several People's Daily commentaries on issues ranging from Taiwan to the trade war.

China's new propaganda song goes viral 02:03
War of words
On May 10, the US raised tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports from 10% to 25%, after talks between the two countries broke down less than a week earlier.
Negotiations have now stalled, with each side blaming the other for the recent setbacks. Speaking in Japan on Monday, US President Donald Trump said he was "not ready" to make a deal.
The US imports far more from China than China does from the US -- one of the reasons for the trade war. As China runs out of US imports to tariff, it has turned to its rare earth exports as a new potential battleground.
China accounted for 80% of all rare earth imports by the US between 2014 and 2017, according to the United States Geological Survey, and are were among the few items not hit by US tariffs.
In statements posted on its website Wednesday, a representative of China's powerful National Development and Reform Commission again hinted at the possibility of action on rare earths.
"What I can tell you is that if anyone wants to use products made of China's rare earth exports to contain China's development, the people of Ganzhou and across China will not be happy with that," the official said, referring to a city in Jiangxi province.
China's latest trade war card isn't as strong as Beijing thinks
On May 20, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited a rare earth factory in Jiangxi province, an unusual personal touch which many analysts and state media saw as a clear message to Washington.
"Will the rare earth become a counter-control weapon against China's unwarranted suppression (by the US)? The answer is not mysterious," the People's Daily commentary said. "In fact, consumer electronics, military equipment and many other products produced in the US are highly dependent on China's rare earth resources
An editorial in state media tabloid Global Times Wednesday was headlined: "US will rue forcing China's hand on rare earths."
But while rare earths could prove a potential pain point for Washington, they may not be the advantage some in China think.
Eugene Gholz, who has advised the US government on rare earths, wrote in a report for the Council on Foreign Relations that China's leverage over the rare earths market peaked in 2010 and even then it had been difficult to exploit in Beijing's favor.
Furthermore, the US also maintains stockpiles of many key rare earth materials, not least those used in the defense industry. China rages against Bolton meeting with Taiwan as anti-invasion drills begin on the island "We also stand resolutely against any attempt to create 'two Chinas' or 'one China, one Taiwan.' This is our clear and consistent position."
As the China and US engage in a tense trade war, however, Washington has been building closer ties with Taiwan, the island that China views as a renegade province.
On Saturday, Taiwan announced it had renamed its unofficial embassy in Washington from the Coordination Council for North American Affairs to the Taiwan Council for US Affairs, after discussions with Washington. That marked the first time a Taiwan government organization had been renamed to include the words "Taiwan" and "US."
"Really got to love the new name," Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said on the ministry's official Twitter.

And in March, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen announced she wanted to purchase advanced new weapons from US President Donald Trump's administration.
Beijing's comments came as Taiwan began its annual Han Kuang Exercise on Tuesday. The military drills are aimed at ensuring the island's readiness for an invasion by communist China's People's Liberation Army (PLA).
President Tsai watched as the air force landed F-16V aircraft on a highway in eastern Changhua county, an exercise designed to test the military's refueling and rearming capacity if major airfields on the island were occupied or destroyed by the PLA.
Hundreds of Taiwanese flocked to the roadside to watch the drill, waving flags and displaying banners showing their support for the island's airforce.
When asked about the future of US-Taiwan defense relations -- and whether the Bolton meeting was the new normal -- Taiwan military spokesman Maj. Gen. Chen Chung-Chi said the two governments would continue to work together.
"In the Asia Pacific region, we are just like the US, who share common core values including freedom of democracy and human rights (with)," he said.
"We also hope that we can play the role of defender of peace in the region. This is to serve the common interests of Taiwan and the US." Huawei CEO says China shouldn't punish Apple The US Department of Commerce placed Huawei on a trade blacklist earlier this month, effectively barring it from conducting business with American companies.
The ban forced suppliers like Google (GOOGL) and ARM Holdings to cut off ties with the Chinese company. Top carriers in the UK and Japan are also delaying the launch of Huawei smartphones.
The US restrictions threaten Huawei's position as the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker and No. 2 smartphone brand.
Washington's ban on the Chinese company "could stir up the smartphone industry by pausing Huawei's positive momentum," analysts at Fitch Ratings wrote in a note on Sunday. The ban could also benefit industry leader Samsung as consumers around the world look for alternatives to Huawei smartphones, they added.
What did Huawei do to land in such hot water with the US?
Huawei and Apple have had vastly different fortunes in Huawei's home market of China.
Huawei shipped nearly 30 million phones in China in the quarter ended March, up 41% compared to the same period last year, according to research firm Canalys.
Meanwhile, Apple saw its iPhone sales in China drop 30% in the same period. The country remains a key market for Apple. Greater China, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, accounted for nearly 18% of net sales in the quarter ended March.
During an earnings call last month, Apple CEO Tim Cook said iPhone sales in China should be boosted by "improved trade dialogue" between Beijing and Washington and "very positive customer response to the pricing actions we've taken in that market."
Huawei could be the first big casualty of China's clash with America
But since then, trade talks between Washington and Beijing broke down, and both sides ratcheted up tensions by slapping more penalties on billions of dollars worth of American and Chinese products.
The renewed trade dispute could hurt Apple, according to Fitch Ratings analysts.
"Apple could be another victim of the US-China trade war and its market-share loss may accelerate in the Chinese market," they said.
US President Donald Trump last week called Huawei "very dangerous," but then said he could see the company being included in a broader trade deal with China.
Ren told Bloomberg that using his company as a bargaining chip is "a big joke."'
"How are we related to China-US trade?" he said. Same-Sex Marriage Fast Facts December 20, 1999 - The Vermont Supreme Court rules that gay and lesbian couples should be given the same rights as heterosexual couples.

/* global CNN */'use strict';jQuery(document).ready(function () {var galleryAdSlide = new CNN.AdSlide('el__gallery', false, CNN.contentModel.singletonFile);}); After years of fierce debate, Taiwan celebrates the first same-sex weddings in Asia It followed two years of fierce debate after the island's Constitutional Court ruled that the existing marriage law was unconstitutional, violating LGBTQ citizens' human rights. The judges gave the island's parliament two years to amend and enact new laws.
After months of stalling and acrimony, the laws finally passed on May 18, just one week before the deadline.
Still, there's no indication that the majority of Taiwan's population is happy to see Wang and Huang and others like them married. A referendum during the 2018 Taiwan local elections asking voters if they supported same-sex marriage failed by a large margin.
In total, 69% of voters said they wanted the marriage code restricted to between a man and a woman.
"Friday will be the darkest day in Taiwan's judiciary history," same-sex marriage opponent Stability of Power Alliance chiarman Sun Chi-Cheng said the day before the historic event.

Joy in Taiwan
It is the day for which LGBT rights activist Chi Chia-Wei has been waiting for more than four decades.
One of the first people in Taiwan to publicly come out as gay, Chi has been campaigning for marriage equality since the 1980s, and was one of the plaintiffs who brought the case in the Constitutional Court which led to its legalization.
"I have been preparing for this day to come, although it took a long while to happen ... But I knew it would eventually come," he said.

Chi was present at the wedding of Wang and Huang on Friday, dressed in a bright red suit with plush rainbow bears attached.
He signed the first Xinyi same-sex couples' marriage registration as a witness, with the same pen Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen used to sign the marriage equality bill just one week ago.
Tsai gifted it to Chi with a handwritten note."May love unite everyone on this land," the president wrote.
Friday was technically Wang's third "wedding" to her wife, Huang. They were both married, unofficially, in January 2018, less than a year after the court decision and again in May shortly after the bill passed.
But they only officially became wife and wife on Friday.

"I'm so proud that Taiwan is on the right side of the history and the first in Asia to have done so ... Taiwan has set an example in making progress in safeguarding human rights," Huang said.
The two, who have been dating for about three years, co-host a YouTube channel called BBDiary. It's named after their nicknames for each other -- BB, a synonym for baby. The video of their first "wedding" in 2018 has since been watched more than 420,000 times on their channel.
For China's LGBTQ people, Taiwan's rainbow victory is a moment of joy and pain
Huang said she first realized the need for equal rights for same-sex relationships when Wang had a medical emergency and she found herself treated by hospital staff not as a loved one, but as a "roommate."
They were standing in the rain last week with thousands of others when the final bills legalizing marriage equality passed, a moment which they both said was "unbelievable."
Huang understands opponents of same-sex marriage. Her own father used to object to her being in a same-sex relationship.
"(After they) got to know my partner better, they came to the realization that gay people aren't what they thought they were," she said.
But not everyone has changed their minds.

'Darkest day'
At Xizhi district in suburban Taipei, Sun announced the formation of the Stability of Power party which aims to end marriage equality at the very moment same-sex couples were tying the knot across the island.
Speaking at the Taiwan legislature Thursday, he said the government's decision to pass same-sex marriage was a "betrayal" of voters, who made their opinion clear in last year's referendum.
"Through President Tsai's manipulation, the people of Taiwan are not only betrayed, but also toyed with while their rights are being abused. In her eyes, people's opinion are nothing but trash," he said.
It's clear the move to endorse same-sex marriage is divisive, to say the least. Three questions on same-sex marriage were asked in the 2018 Taiwan referendum. In all cases voters rejected same-sex marriage but weren't opposed to Taiwan's LGBTQ couples having rights other than marriage.
Sun Chi-Cheng, chairman of the Stability of Power Alliance, announced a new political party in Taiwan Friday opposing same-sex marriage
{"@context": "http://schema.org","@type": "ImageObject","name": "Sun Chi-Cheng, chairman of the Stability of Power Alliance, announced a new political party in Taiwan Friday opposing same-sex marriage","description": "Sun Chi-Cheng, chairman of the Stability of Power Alliance, announced a new political party in Taiwan Friday opposing same-sex marriage","url": "//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190523201212-04-taiwan-lgbtq-sun-chi-cheng-large-169.jpg",}
But given the Constitutional Court's decision, legislators couldn't leave the law as it was, which led to extensive negotiations and concessions.
The final version doesn't mention "same-sex marriage" specifically, instead saying couples of the same gender are allowed "marriage registration." It doesn't allow LGBTQ couples full adoption rights either.
But Sun said that isn't enough and he wants the marriages outlawed. His group will put up candidates at the 2020 election to run on the issue. "Let's elect a new president and new legislators next year. And we will overturn the bills," he said.
One of Sun's volunteers, Becky Huang, said gay people in Taiwan don't actually want to get married, blaming legislators for stoking the issue for personal gain. "I have a gay nephew. He doesn't want to get married," she said.

'Faith, hope and love'
If Taiwan does backtrack on same-sex rights, it would be a decision in keeping with an increasingly conservative region.
In recent years, LGBTQ rights across Asia have seen repeated backtracks and growing obstacles as local governments become more reluctant to embrace their gay populations.
Activists had hoped the Taiwan decision would create a surge of support for same-sex marriage across Asia, but so far, only China has reacted to the announcement, apparently attempting to take credit for the advance in a tweet with a gif saying "love is love."
Just days after Taiwan's legislature passed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage for the first time in Asia, couples register their marital status and receive new identification cards, Friday.

Homosexuality is not illegal on the mainland, but same-sex marriage is not permitted and activists there don't see the situation changing any time soon.
Taiwan's gay men and women may now be able to marry but say the battle for their rights isn't over. "We all know that, even though the bills have been passed, this won't be the end of the fight," newly-wed Huang said.
Chi said he was optimistic about the future of same-sex marriage in Taiwan, despite Sun's attempts to rally opposition to the new laws. He believes that people will grow used to the change once they see that same-sex couples are just like everyone else.
To his fellow same-sex marriage advocates across Asia, Chi has a simple message: "Faith, hope and love. Keep your faith, hold onto your hope and continue to love."

That decision holds special significance for China's LGBTQ community given the cultural and historical connections between Taiwan and the mainland. Originally one population, the two sides have been separated since the end of a bloody civil war in 1949, but still share a language and many traditions.
Activists say the ruling proves that same-sex marriage is not incompatible with Chinese culture.
"We know it's marriage equality in Taiwan, not in mainland China, but we still feel so happy," said Peng. "For us, the right to marry isn't just a political argument but (it's about) our everyday life -- we want to see our relationships recognized."
But the moment is also bittersweet for the LGBTQ community in China, where same-sex marriage is still illegal -- a situation that shows no sign of changing.

A bright spot
While Chinese citizens might celebrate Taiwan's legalization of same-sex marriage, they won't be able to take advantage of it. The law says that citizens of governments without marriage equality won't be allowed to get legally married in Taiwan.
Cecilia Yang, who is from Wuhan in Central China, wants to marry her Taiwanese partner but without same-sex marriage on the mainland, that won't be possible.
"When my partner told me the news, she was so excited. Then we looked at each other and had more mixed feelings," she said.
Homosexuality is not illegal in China and, in 2001, the authorities removed it from the official list of mental disorders. But LGBTQ people in China still face persistent discrimination and prejudices from both the government and public -- let alone enjoying rights, such as the ability to jointly adopt children, inherit property and marry their partners.
In 2016, Chinese censors even banned the portrayal of "abnormal sexual behavior" in TV and online shows, including gay and lesbian relationships.
Not only that, but the space for LGBTQ activism has shrunk in recent years.

Since he came to power in late 2012, Chinese President Xi Jinping has increasingly stressed the ruling Communist Party's absolute control over all aspects of society, resulting in a push for more rigid moral codes. In a landscape where freedom of speech and protests against the government are rarely tolerated, Human Rights Watch China researcher Maya Wang said LGBTQ activism had been a "relatively bright spot" in Chinese civil society.
China's young people have been increasingly supporting of same-sex relationships, Wang added, with some draping themselves in the rainbow flag at their graduations or supporting inclusion on university campuses.
She warned, however, that harassment and restrictions on their activities had increased in recent years. LGBT-themed books have been restricted in the country's libraries. Last November, an author of same-sex erotic fiction was sent to jail for ten years.
Wang said the fickle Chinese government could implement a crackdown on LGBT rights supporters at a moment's notice. "You have to be very careful being an activist in China," she said.

A message to the world
The Chinese leadership has never shown any indication of support for LGBTQ rights, but a strange thing happened on Sunday after the Taiwanese legislation passed. It tried to take credit for it.
"Local lawmakers in Taiwan, China, have legalized same-sex marriage in a first for Asia," tweeted the Communist Party's official newspaper, People's Daily, on Friday, along with a rainbow color-infused animated image that said "love is love" underneath.
The post was disingenuous given the fact that Taiwan and China have been governed separately for seven decades, although Beijing considers Taiwan a renegade province and part of its territory.
var id = '//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js'.replace(/\s+/g, '');!!document.getElementById(id) || (function makeEmbedScript(d, id) {var js,fjs;js = d.createElement('script');js.id = id;js.charset = 'utf-8';js.setAttribute('async', '');fjs = d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);js.src = '//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';}(document, id));
The tweet provoked fury in Taiwan's government, but it wasn't the only LGBTQ-friendly opinion published in English by Chinese state media. Global Times, a state-run tabloid known for its nationalistic rhetoric, posted a video Saturday showcasing and praising gay social life in Beijing.
It isn't clear if this celebration of Taiwan's decision in Chinese state media represented real momentum in a change in Beijing's position or if it was just cynical opportunism.
Wang said she was skeptical. "The Chinese government is often quite adaptive to making use of popular incidents and transforming it into issues that bolster their power," she said.
In the unlikely scenario that the Chinese government did embrace homosexuality, it wouldn't be unprecedented, according to Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the University of London.
"If you go back in history, there were times when same-sex relationships were widely practiced and accepted in China," he said. "After the collapse of the Han Dynasty, and before reunification under the Shu Dynasty, you have several hundred years when it was widely accepted."
You can't erase them
It isn't just China that is playing politics on this issue. Tsang said the ruling could boost Taiwan's reputation internationally among Western nations.
For decades, Taipei has been losing an international battle as Beijing forces diplomatic allies to choose between Taiwan and China, leaving the island relatively isolated. Lagging Beijing in economic and political power, Taipei is only formally recognized by 17 countries.
The landmark LGBTQ ruling might not be enough to turn that diplomatic tide, Tsang said, it will burnish Taiwan's reputation as a liberal bastion in Asia.
There was even hope before the same-sex marriage law was passed in Taiwan that such a move could spark a wave of support for LGBTQ rights across the region -- including in China.
But Yang, the Wuhan native, said she didn't believe marriage equality in Taiwan would inspire support for same-sex marriage inside the Chinese government.
"We have a very different political environment here. It's going to be very difficult to achieve it -- my partner and I don't feel very hopeful," she said.
For LGBTQ rights activist Peng, a better future is still on the horizon for his cause in China.
"I'm seeing more and more gay Chinese come out of the closet and live the lives they want," he said.
"You can't erase all these living, breathing human beings no matter how much Chinese civil society is being squeezed. We just need more time."

As churches are demolished at home, Chinese Christians find religious freedom in Kenya "Publicly, it's dangerous to be a Christian in China right now," says Jonathon Chow, 43, a senior pastor at the Bread of Life Church, which is headquartered in Taiwan but has 500 ministries, including many in West Africa.
Previously, the organization's churches in Africa tended to be run and attended by Africans, he says. But increasingly Bread of Life is seeing Chinese-led congregations forming across the continent, as more Chinese move to Africa and interact with local values.

The Golden Lampstand Church, in China, was demolished with dynamite and heavy machinery in January 2018.
Throughout the service, a middle-aged couple from Shandong province, who say they are new to Kenya and the ministry, post audio clips of hymns and photographs of readings onto WeChat, a social network closely monitored by the Chinese government.
"Most of the congregation here got saved in Kenya," says Chow. "Unless they were a believer before they came, most don't know a lot about the Christian conditions in China."
'The Kenyan wedding everyone is talking about'
The first time Liang Yongyu met Karen Ngunjiri at the billboard advertising company where they both worked in Nairobi, he told her she would be his wife.
Him being Chinese? Not a problem. But him not being a Christian, I thought that was going to be a big issue
Karen Ngunjiri
The pair dated for 6 months, then hit a roadblock that threatened to scupper his swaggering prediction. Liang, 33, was not a Christian.
"That was a deal breaker for me," says Ngunjiri, 29, who spent four years studying Mandarin in Nanning, south-west China. "Him being Chinese? Not a problem. But him not being a Christian, I thought that was going to be a big issue. How would we bring up our children?"
Liang had lived in Kenya for a "long time," could speak some Swahili and had been "hearing a lot about Christianity" from his Kenyan friends, Ngunjiri says. After some soul searching, he said he "was open to exploring what Christianity had to offer," she adds.
Liang connected with a church in Nairobi that held services in Cantonese -- the language spoken in his home province of Guangdong, in southern China, and Hong Kong, where the pastors who founded the ministry were from.
In December 2018, those Hong Kong pastors married the couple in a Christian ceremony in the shadow of Mount Kenya in front of 200 guests -- "a small wedding for Kenya," jokes Ngunjiri.
Weeks later, a video of their wedding went viral on YouTube with the title: "THE KENYAN WEDDING EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT." Ngunjiri still doesn't know who uploaded it, but for months the newlyweds couldn't walk down the street in Nairobi without being recognized. The novelty of a Kenyan woman marrying a Chinese man had got people's attention.
Liang Yongyu and Karen Ngunjiri were married near Mount Kenya after he converted to Christianity for her.

"Some of the comments (online) were horrible," she says, of the video that has since been taken down, but at its peak had nearly 300,000 views, according to Ngunjiri. "Especially from Kenyans. There's this idea that the Chinese are here to steal our jobs or colonize us. So the joke was now they're stealing our women."
In 2017, China was Kenya's largest trading partner and, in 2014, the country was home to an estimated 40,000 Chinese migrants. But their relations with Kenyans have, at times, been tense.
In 2015, a Chinese restaurateur reportedly banned African patrons after 5 p.m., last year a Chinese boss was deported from Kenya after being caught on video calling an employee a "monkey," and local media has claimed that Kenyan workers on the Chinese-built railway have been treated like second-class citizens by their foreign employers.
Kenyans are also concerned about how much debt their country owes to China. Last year, in a seeming show of strength against Chinese dominance President Kenyatta Uhuru banned imports of cheap Chinese fish, amid claims it was squeezing out local produce. But his ban was soon reversed: Kenya does not produce enough fish to feed itself.

Kenyan workers on the Standard Gauge Railway; Chinese supervisors on the platform in Nairobi; Kenyan staff man the modern terminal.
The anti-Chinese commentators on Ngunjiri's wedding video, however, had perhaps missed the point.
Rather than Ngunjiri being overpowered by Chinese culture, it was Liang who had changed his faith and agreed to a Christian African wedding with just 20 Chinese guests who didn't include his mother, embracing a new culture 5,300 miles from home.
A new door opens
An estimated 1 million Chinese have moved to the African continent in the 21st century, according to journalist Howard French's book "China's Second Continent," amid growing trade ties between the two regions. But what is perhaps unique about Kenya's Chinese population, and why it is embracing the country's religious culture, is its diversity. A 2015 study found the Chinese in Kenya are spread "across every sector in a significant way."
This makes a difference. Employees of government-owned giants, shipped out to build roads in Uganda or airports in Zimbabwe, for example, are typically bused to and from work and must stay inside their compounds in the evenings and at weekends unless given approval to leave by a manager. But in Nairobi -- a vibrant city home to African tech giant M-Pesa, which revolutionized mobile banking in East Africa -- a younger generation of Chinese are working in the private sector, freer to explore new cultures and belief systems through their personal connections with local people.

Annie Hu, 30, began attending church in Kenya; Chinese and Kenyan employees mix at a media company office; the China Center where many Chinese expats have businesses.
Among them is Annie Hu, 30, who relocated to Kenya five years ago and works for a Chinese financial technology, or fintech, giant. She says the 9-to-5 "pole pole" (meaning "slowly slowly" in Swahili) lifestyle here is more attractive than the 9-9-6 grind -- working 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week -- at some of China's biggest technology companies in the country's Silicon Valley city of Shenzhen, where she relocated from.
"Living in a developing country and international city you encounter different nationalities, races and lifestyles," Hu says. After frequently traveling for work to the Muslim majority city of Dar es Salaam, in Tanzania, she went to Lebanon and Jordan last year to learn more about Muslim culture. "It opened a totally new door for me," she says. Asked how she felt about China's treatment of Muslims, Hu replies: "We need more understanding."
Once we engage with the local community, it's inevitable we are invited to join the church
Annie Hu, Nairobi resident
Hu's family is Buddhist but in Nairobi she has attended Christian churches, including one led by Hong Kong pastors, as well as a Maasai church. "Kenyans believe in God more than my Western friends," she says. "Once we engage with the local community it's inevitable we are invited to join the church. These people are very friendly and reliable and they try to build a supportive community for the Chines e."
Chow from Bread of Life agrees the church is an important social network for newcomers. "I also think the cultural differences and the hardship the Chinese experience here means they are more open to the gospel," he says.
For Hu, flirting with various Christian communities hasn't resulted in a full conversion. "It's brought more different religions into my life ... But I didn't reach a point where I felt I want to become a serious Christian yet. Not yet," she adds.
The world's biggest Christian nation?
It is not only the Chinese in Kenya who are embracing Christianity. Many Chinese students in America, Australia and the UK are returning home Christian, says Ian Johnson, author of "The Souls of China: The Return of Religion After Mao." Their conversion chimes with a broader trend at home: China itself is on track to be the world's biggest Christian nation by 2030, by some estimates.
For much of the 20th century, Chinese citizens were taught to worship the founding father of the Communist Party, Mao Zedong, the revolutionary leader who destroyed much of the nation's Buddhist and Taoist religious infrastructure during the Cultural Revolution. "There used to be 900 temples in Beijing alone," says Johnson. "Now there are 20."

Mao's death in 1976 left the Chinese searching for a new value system. Christianity seemed fresh and modern to the country's newly urban residents, Johnson says, although more people in China are still Buddhist.
By 2017, there were between 93 million and 115 million Christians in China -- around 5% of the country's population -- but fewer than 30 million practice in official churches, according to Purdue University scholar Yang Fenggang. If those estimates pan out, there would now be almost as many Christians in China as there are members of the Communist Party, which had an estimated 90 million members in 2016.
That has riled the government. Under President Xi Jinping rhetoric has grown on the need to "Sinicize" religions perceived to be Western, despite the fact many Christians in China do not feel "un-Chinese or foreign," says Johnson.

Today, only state-sanctioned Christian organizations are legal in China. Overcrowded state churches run as many as 5 services a day and their pastors' wages are paid by the government, says Johnson. The alternatives are so-called house churches which operate illegally but can offer a more personal ministry, with pastors on first-name terms with their congregation.
For years, such churches were tolerated in China but recently they have become a target of the authorities and their requests to register with the state are often rejected.
In December 2018, one of China's best-known underground ministries, the Early Rain Covenant Church, in Chengdu, was raided. The pastor and his wife were charged with "inciting subversion," which can carry a 15-year prison sentence, and more than 100 worshipers were arrested.
An underground church in Kenya
Kenya is not a place you'd expect to find an underground church. Christianity is the lifeblood of the nation's politics and societal fabric, and is celebrated in huge, rambunctious services attended by thousands of dancing and singing worshipers.
But, in the northern stretches of the sprawling, traffic-choked capital of 4 million people, an underground Chinese house church is exactly what May Li, wife of a Malaysian-Chinese pastor, helps to lead -- illustrating just how far the Communist Party's religious crackdown has traveled. Li and other Chinese Christians in this story did not want to use their real names for fear of being punished by the government when they return to China.
The Chinese embassy in Nairobi has already reached out to the leaders of some Chinese Christian groups in the city and asked them to desist, says Li. Her service tries to stay below the radar.
It's notable that the three main Christian churches in Nairobi are run by Chinese pastors from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Malaysia -- places outside mainland China where Chinese people enjoy more Christian religious freedom.
A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Mofa) in Beijing said it was "not aware" of this situation, adding that China does not have "so-called house churches."
"The Chinese government respects its people's religious freedom and protects normal religious activities and legitimate rights of religious organizations, and manages religious issues pertaining to national and public interests in accordance with law," the spokesperson said via fax. "At the same time, we require all religions to obey national laws and carry out activities within the law."
On Sunday afternoons, Li's underground church meets in a small basement room of a huge Kenyan church. No photography is allowed. No names of attendees can be revealed. No Chinese person here wants to be outed as a Christian.
The Bread of Life service is held in a high-rise office tower, which is busy Monday to Friday but empty on Sundays apart from this church.

"These people will one day go back to China," says Li, explaining that this congregation is a transient group often working in Kenya for short stints. Most were Christian before they came and, if they belonged to a house church, are aware of some of the risks.
Church translator Grace Zhang, from Hubei province, falls into that category. "Things are very difficult for my church in China right now," says Zhang, who did not want her real name used. She became a Christian with her mother in 2002 and relocated to Kenya to proselytize to Chinese abroad, as well as to Kenyans.
Despite her work, Zhang hesitates to call herself a missionary -- "that's a sensitive word," she says. Chinese law bans missionary work in China. Instead, Zhang prefers the term "cultural mediator."
Many Africans from Uganda, Burundi, Kenya and Sudan also attend the bilingual service, which is delivered in English and Mandarin, hoping to improve their language skills or learn more about China. "God gave them the burden of loving the Chinese," Zhang says.
Through their interaction at the church, Zhang helps Africans and Chinese better understand each other. She explains to the Chinese, for example, that Kenyans place a high value on in-depth greetings, meaning that asking about the well-being of multiple family members is a cultural necessity. She warns Africans that many Chinese do not respond well to overly physical greetings.
"We try to learn from both sides," she says.
China vs God ... going home
In Chinese state media, the clampdown on faith goes largely unreported and Christianity is "virtually invisible," says Johnson -- the government doesn't want to "encourage anyone to think about religion."
That explains why worshipers at the Bread of Life church in Nairobi are open about sharing their Christianity. This is a more settled congregation. Having found religion abroad and been out of China for several years, in most cases, they often simply do not know the extent of their government's crackdown, says Chow -- although many have a sense the government is not enthusiastic about religion.
When members want to repatriate, however, they have to be enlightened of the potential risks.
Maggie Wong, 35, a pastor at Bread of Life, says the church tries to prepare them for what they will face and has a network of underground churches to connect them with. "It's very stressful," she says.

"From a spiritual perspective, I think it's not easy for returnees to survive when they go back to their home country if they live overseas," says Zhang, from the underground church. "When they go back we keep in touch with them and even Skype for bible study."
Some Christians in Kenya, however, who learn of the potential dangers that await them in China say it could be a deterrent from returning.
Jimmy Hong Zhen Wu, 53, a trader from Guangdong province, became Christian during the decade he has spent living in Kenya, where his wife has given birth to two daughters now under 8 years old. He travels to China regularly for work and says he is conscious of the double life he would need to lead back home.
"In public, in China we can't speak about our faith," says Wu, who did not want his real name used. "Only with friends and family can we say we are Christian."
Whether his daughters, who have spent their lives in a proudly Christian society attending church every Sunday, will understand those confines if their family one day heads back to China remains to be seen.
Editor's Note: This story has been updated to clarify remarks by Annie Hu in her interview with Jenni Marsh on April 1, 2019. Taiwan furious after China attempts to take credit for LGBT marriage win "(People's Daily) is a commie brainwasher and it sucks."
Taiwan and China are separated by fewer than 130 kilometers (81 miles) at their closest point. For seven decades, the two have maintained an uneasy truce following their split at the end of a bloody civil war in 1949.
Unification is a long-term aim for China's ruling Communist Party, which regards self-governed Taiwan -- an island of 23 million people -- as a renegade province.
The historic vote in Taiwan came almost two years after the island's Constitutional Court ruled existing laws -- which defined marriage as between a man and a woman -- to be unconstitutional.
Despite sharply divided public opinions, Taiwan's legislators passed the law only a week before a court-set deadline to enact marriage equality laws. It will go into effect on May 24.
As thousands of people in Taipei took to the streets to celebrate the outcome, Beijing's propaganda authorities appeared to see an opportunity to stake a claim on China's sovereignty over Taiwan and to highlight China's supposed LGBT-friendliness.
The news from Taiwan was among trending topics Friday on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. It has remained a widely discussed story, generating largely positive comments, despite the Chinese government's growing censorship on all LGBT-related subjects on social media.
Global Times, a state-run tabloid known for its nationalistic rhetoric, posted a video Saturday showcasing gay social life in Beijing. The three-minute clip features interviews with local advocates as well as foreigners praising the Chinese capital's inclusive culture, complete with footage of drag queen performances.
Homosexuality is not illegal in China and the authorities in 2001 removed it from the official list of mental disorders. But activists and experts agree that prejudices and discrimination persist, as well as periodic government crackdowns.
Since he came to power in late 2012, Chinese President Xi Jinping has increasingly stressed the Communist Party's absolute control over all aspects of society, resulting in a push for more rigid moral codes and even less room for LGBT visibility and advocacy.
In March, nearly all LGBT content was scrubbed from "Bohemian Rhapsody," the award-winning biopic of British rock band Queen, for the Chinese audience. Deleted scenes range from two men kissing to the word "gay."
Last November, an author of same-sex erotic fiction was sent to jail for ten years. In 2016, Chinese censors banned the portrayal of "abnormal sexual behavior" in TV and online shows, including gay and lesbian relationships.
Still, some Chinese activists want to focus on the positive impact of Taiwan's legalization of same-sex marriage may have on the mainland.
"It offers us a lot of hope," Xiaogang Wei, a leading LGBT rights activist who heads the Beijing Gender Health Education Institute, told CNN on Friday.
"The Chinese government has pointed to cultural tradition as a reason for same-sex marriage being unsuitable in China. But the decision in Taiwan, which shares a cultural tradition with us, proves that Chinese culture can be open, diverse and progressive." Quickly catch up on the day's news -- A court ruled that the ex-king of Belgium will be fined more than $5,000 each day until he takes a paternity test. Here's the story.
-- Grumpy Cat, a beloved hero of the internet, died at age 7.
-- What could be better than Batman? Batwoman. Especially when she's being played by Ruby Rose. The "Orange Is the New Black" actress appeared in the first trailer for the upcoming series.
-- A pretty name for a special view. Catch the rare "blue flower moon" Saturday night. Taiwan legalizes same-sex marriage in historic first for Asia Tens of thousands of people braved pouring rain Friday to demonstrate in favor of same-sex marriage outside the parliament, as lawmakers began voting on three draft bills, one tabled by the island's Cabinet -- which would ultimately prove successful -- and two watered-down rival bills tabled by conservative groups.
The successful Cabinet bill was the only one to use the word "marriage." It was backed by LGBTQ groups, despite the fact it could see same-sex couples denied rights enjoyed by hetrosexual couples, such as adoption and cross-national marriage.
Wu Tzu-an, a 33-year-old gay artist from Taipei, was among the crowds outside the parliament celebrating Friday.
"Today the result was the best we got for this stage," said Wu. "It's also a sign to show that Taiwan was different from China," he added, referring to mainland China where same-sex marriage has not been legalized. "Personally I don't have plans to get married, but I think it's a sign for equality."

Xiaogang Wei, who heads the Beijing Gender Health Education Institute, called the bill's passing a historic moment, not only for Asia but for the global LGBTQ rights movement.
"It will have a very positive impact on China's LGBT community, offering us a lot of hope," he told CNN.
"The Chinese government has pointed to cultural tradition as a reason for same-sex marriage being unsuitable in China. But the decision in Taiwan, which shares a cultural tradition with us, proves that Chinese culture can be open, diverse and progressive."
After the vote, Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen tweeted: "We took a big step towards true equality, and made Taiwan a better country."
Longtime struggle
Friday's decision has been a long time in the making.
In 2015, veteran gay rights activist Chi Chia-wei -- who has spent 30 years fighting for marriage equality -- filed a request to the Constitutional Court asking for a ruling on an article in the island's civil code stating that marriage is between a man and a woman.
The Taipei city government filed a similar request the same year after three same-sex couples lodged an administrative lawsuit against the government when their marriage registrations were rejected, CNA reported.
var id = '//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js'.replace(/\s+/g, '');!!document.getElementById(id) || (function makeEmbedScript(d, id) {var js,fjs;js = d.createElement('script');js.id = id;js.charset = 'utf-8';js.setAttribute('async', '');fjs = d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);js.src = '//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';}(document, id));
In 2017, the court ruled the law violated the constitution.
Lawmakers were given a two-year deadline, but reached a deadlock. Taiwan's gay marriage opponents seized the opportunity to put forward a referendum asking voters whether they agreed with same-sex marriage.
Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights executive director Victoria Hsu, who represented Chi during his case, said she expected attitudes towards LGBTQ people to improve after the bill as they would see that heterosexual families "wouldn't lose anything."
But Hsu -- who plans to register her marriage with her partner of six years when the bill takes effect next Friday -- said more still needed to be done to make LGBTQ people truly equal.
"The fight is not over, but we will continue from this brand-new start," she added.
Amnesty International Taiwan's acting director Annie Huang agreed, saying: "The Taiwanese government must not stop here. It needs to act to eliminate all forms of discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, gender identities and intersex status."

LGBTQ rights in Asia
Taiwan's vote sets it apart from other parts of Asia where LGBTQ rights have regressed.
In mainland China, where homosexuality is legal but prejudices and discrimination against LGBT people persist under Communist Party rule, an author of same-sex erotic fiction was sent to jail for 10 years in November.
In April, the ruler of the tiny, oil-rich kingdom of Brunei announced he would introduce death by stoning for those convicted of gay sex. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah has since said the death penalty will not be imposed, although he did not repeal the law.
In Indonesia, declining secularism has led to deepening discrimination against the country's gay, lesbian and transgender communities. Last year, two men accused of being gay received 87 lashes for gay sex in the country's conservative Aceh province.
More than two dozen countries around the world allow gay marriage, according to Pew Research.

Police arrested and charged three people in a ghastly killing of a pregnant teen in Chicago. Marlen Ochoa-Lopez, 19, disappeared late last month after she went to receive an offer of free baby clothes from a woman she had communicated with online. Ochoa-Lopez's body was found Tuesday in a garbage can in the backyard of the woman who had offered the clothes. She had been strangled and her unborn baby forcibly removed from her womb, police said. The baby is in grave condition at a hospital. Two people, including the woman who police say lured the teen to the home, were charged with murder, while a third person was charged with concealment of a crime.

4. SAT tests
Students who come from tough backgrounds just might catch a break the next time they take the SAT. The College Board, the nonprofit group that runs the standardized test, said it will start assigning a score to students who take the SAT to reflect their social and economic backgrounds. The Environmental Context Dashboard would factor in things such as crime and poverty in a student's neighborhood to capture their "resourcefulness to overcome challenges and achieve more with less." This dashboard score will not include a student's race. College admissions are under heightened scrutiny after indictments were handed down against wealthy and powerful parents who allegedly paid their kids' ways into elite universities.

5. Canada and the Philippines
Canada and the Philippines are feeling some kind of way about each other right now. The two countries are having a diplomatic squabble -- over trash. And not just any old trash, mind you. They're fighting about 6-year-old trash. The tensions have gotten so bad that the Philippines has recalled its ambassador to Canada. This trash tiff started in 2013 when more than 100 containers of material from Canada arrived in the Port of Manila. It was supposed to be recyclable plastic; it turned out to be nonrecyclable plastic, household waste and diapers. Now Canada is accused of violating an international treaty governing the transport of hazardous waste. The Philippines wants the garbage gone, and President Rodrigo Duterte has threatened to ship it all back and "throw them into the shores or beach of Canada."

Severe weather threat possible this weekend across central US 01:46
AND FINALLY ...
Take a dip
It's Friday, and the world's largest Jello pool beckons. (Click to view.) Trump's trade war shows how China has lost all its friends in Washington "There is a broad hawkishness on China that straddles left, right, and center," said Patrick Lozada, China director at the Washington-based strategic advisory firm Albright Stonebridge Group (ASG). "The problem with this consensus is that in the absence of a credible counter-argument, the actual facts on the ground can sometimes be lost as people compete to see who can be more hawkish."

Trade war
When Trump introduced new tariffs on Chinese products last year, there were complaints from top Democrats -- that he didn't go far enough.
"The United States must take strong, smart and strategic action against China's brazenly unfair trade policies," Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said at the time. "Yet, today's announcement is merely a start, and the Trump Administration must do much more to fight for American workers and products."
Even today, as the expansion of those tariffs have started to bite both consumers and manufacturers at home, offering a tantalizing attack line for Democrats in 2020, criticisms from those in the party's leadership are of Trump's execution, not his target.
"We should not be having a multifront war on tariffs," Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer said this week. "I would focus everything on China. And get the Europeans, Canadians and Mexicans to be on our side and focus on China. Because they are the great danger."
On Trump's side of the aisle, voices critical of his deal have been outweighed by Republicans wanting to take an even harder line on China -- even as many sought to rein him in on expanding tariffs against European allies.
"The President is right to hold China's feet the fire on this," Senator John Barrasso told CNN on Wednesday. "They wouldn't be negotiating at all if it weren't for what the President has done ... The President has his own timeline. I support what he is doing."
US President Donald Trump (L) and China's President Xi Jinping leave a business leaders event at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on November 9, 2017.

Broad front
"I'm hard-pressed to think of another consensus in American foreign policy that's moved as far and as fast as the US consensus on China," Richard Hass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, a New York-based think tank, said in February.
"People have grown weary of Chinese trade practices, of technology theft. But it's also a reflection of what's going inside China ... with the treatment of the Uyghurs, the abolition of (term) limits by the president. And it's also because of strategic concerns such as the South China Sea and what China has done there."
Lozada, the ASG analyst, said that "Beijing has failed to grasp the changing nature of US politics and the growing concerns about the slow pace of reform in China. When President Trump took office, they regarded him as a transactional businessman without taking serious his remarks about trade on the campaign trail and growing skepticism of China's role in the global economy at all levels."
Bipartisan China hawkishness isn't only hurting Beijing on trade either.
Human rights, often an overlooked topic in relations with Beijing, have come back to the fore, along with calls for punitive sanctions that would further weaken China's economy in the middle of a trade war.
This week, leading Hong Kong democrats were on Capitol Hill to testify before the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), a bipartisan panel which issues an annual report on the state of human rights in China and has grown in influence under the Trump administration.
In his opening remarks, CECC chair James McGovern, a Democratic congressman, said he believed "it is time for the United States to consider new and innovative policies to support the people of Hong Kong."
McGovern and others have suggested Washington review the US-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, under which it treats the city as a separate customs territory to the rest of China, so long as Hong Kong remains "sufficiently autonomous." Suspending Hong Kong's special status could devastate the city's economy and also hit Beijing hard, given its reliance on Hong Kong's financial sector.
CECC members, including Republican Senator Marco Rubio, have called for China to be sanctioned under the Magnitsky Acts for its oppression of the Uyghur minority in Xinjiang, where hundreds of thousands if not millions of mostly Muslim people have been detained in "re-education camps."
The Magnitsky Acts, which impose visa sanctions and asset freezes on alleged human rights violators, were originally introduced to go after Russia and have since been expanded to target officials from Myanmar, Saudi Arabia, and other countries.
A bipartisan group of lawmakers, led by Rubio, have called for China to be added to the list. Doing so would strike a major blow against the finances and freedom to travel of top Chinese officials, but would also torpedo any hopes of improving relations with Beijing.

Dangers of further split
Despite widespread skepticism and hostility towards China in Washington today, better bilateral relations in the past paid off for both countries. China's economy exploded after it entered the WTO in 2000, and the US has long enjoyed the benefits of cheap Chinese manufacturing.
The chances of relations reaching a breaking point and turning into an open conflict are slight, but very real. US military leaders have expressed alarm over China's moves in the South China Sea and towards Taiwan, as Washington has ramped up its own military engagement in the region, something Beijing regards as a provocation.
Taiwan has bought weapons from the US and lobbied for even greater support from Washington. The island's de facto independence from China has always been guaranteed to some extent by a belief that the US may come to its aid in a military conflict with Beijing.
While relations are unlikely to sour to the point of actual conflict there is a risk of a new Cold War developing, with other nations forced to choose sides.
That could create a bloc allied against Washington, something that it has not faced since the height of the original Cold War. As commentator Henry Luce wrote in December, better relations between Washington and Beijing under Nixon helped exacerbate the Sino-Soviet split, one factor which resulted in the USSR's eventual collapse.
"Mr Trump is triggering a 'reverse Nixon'," Luce wrote. "Decades of convergence is going into reverse. It is happening at a speed that is taking even Americans by surprise."
That was five months ago, and things have only sped up since then. What are China's naval goals? The West can't wait to find out But despite its resources, China and the PLAN face challenges and shortfalls that preclude it from being the threat these advances might suggest.
Pentagon says China's military using espionage to steal secrets
One big problem: China's military branches still don't work that well together, despite a strong push by President Xi Jinping that they do so and recent reforms establishing joint theater commands.
The PLA has yet to demonstrate full service integration in its exercises, suggesting much work remains to be done. Joint exercises continue to be small-scale, and the services' roles in them remain separated either physically or chronologically.
This means gaps remain in multi-service operations, particularly in operations beyond the First Island Chain or "Far Seas."
China enjoys surveillance superiority over the waters near its coast (the Near Seas) but not in the Far Seas. Its lack of sea-based air power and overseas bases to provide land-based air support limits the PLAN's capacity to project power ashore by other than land-attack cruise missiles or unmanned systems.
While the PLAN has significantly increased its overseas operations since it started anti-piracy operations 11 years ago, it has yet to demonstrate the capability to protect its sea lines of communications through the Indian Ocean, through which 70% of China's energy requirements and over 80% of its trade must pass.
China's military is going from strength to strength under Xi Jinping
It has a naval support base in Djibouti and access agreements in the region, but the PLAN's logistics train lacks the capacity to support the deployed forces required to counter a major opponent.
Nonetheless, China's maritime challenge is very real.
It has initiated a massive oceanographic research and survey effort across virtually all the world's oceans. And the PLAN does operate globally, conducting exercises with more than 30 nations and operating in all the world's oceans and four of the seven seas.
And China's marine strategy, authored by its Maritime Commerce Ministry, brings numbers to bear that no country can match, by closely integrating China's civic, commercial, diplomatic and naval operations.
For example, Chinese companies and merchant shipping constituted the first responders to Mozambique following recent typhoon devastation. The PLAN has a supporting role in that strategy, advancing China's economic and political interests.
While regional goals, including dominance of the "near seas" -- Taiwan and the South China Sea -- remain the PLAN's main focus, China's leaders are addressing the PLAN's worldwide ambitions and plan to achieve those goals before 2050.
New satellite images may reveal China's next aircraft carrier
The West's experts and intelligence community must monitor its progress closely, shedding past assumptions when assessing new information to provide decision makers the insights required to anticipate and forestall any aggressive designs that China may harbor.
Deterring conflict requires adequate force levels and clear understanding of all the parties' actions and intentions.
To this point, the West has done a poor job figuring this out and is now playing catch-up.
Capt. Fanell described it as the "US intelligence community and academia miscalculation of the scope, scale and timing of the PLAN's modernization and its impact on US national security."
China presently maintains a near global presence on the world's oceans, its fleet is growing rapidly and its intentions seem more assertive than Beijing's official statements profess. If dominating any portion of the "Far Seas" is China's goal, waiting for Beijing to achieve it before responding is not an option that assures peace.
China is employing an integrated multi-agency approach to expanding its influence in every continent. It has established economic links with countries across the world, and its Belt and Road Initiate (BRI) has both continental and maritime dimensions. Its media outlets, commercial companies, diplomats and military all have roles in Beijing's national strategy. Countering China's strategy will require a similar comprehensive diplomatic, economic and military response. Bitcoin bull predicts prices will triple by 2021 — but fears 'melt-up' in stocks "It would take something like that to shatter this newfound confidence," said Novogratz, who is the founder and CEO of Galaxy Digital, a crypto merchant bank.
Hackers steal $40 million worth of bitcoin in massive security breach
Confidence did not appear to be shaken by a massive security breach at one of the world's largest currency exchanges. Bitcoin prices rallied despite the news that hackers stole $40 million of bitcoin from Binance, a Taiwan-based company.
"For institutions to feel comfortable, you've got to have a lot less of this," he said.
Novogratz urged crypto exchanges to "self-regulate" to bolster their security and instill confidence in bitcoin.
"A little bit of guardrails can go a long way," he said.
Others remain deeply skeptical of bitcoin due in part to the extreme price swings.
Nouriel "Dr. Doom" Roubini knocked bitcoin on Wednesday at SALT as the "mother and father of all bubbles and busts." Roubini, a professor at New York University, noted that bitcoin's crash far exceeds those experienced after the dotcom bubble and even the tulip mania of the 1630s.
Bitcoin has "no future as a currency" and is subject to "massive manipulation," Roubini said.
'Frothy' stock market
While Novogratz remains uber-bullish on bitcoin, he's concerned about overexuberance in the stock market.
"We've got a chance of an equity melt-up. You're seeing that in the enthusiasm around IPOs," Novogratz said.
On Friday, Uber is going public in a blockbuster IPO set to raise around $9 billion or more. Last week, Beyond Meat (BYND) spiked 163% on its IPO day. It was the strongest first-day pop for a US company since March 2000 when Palm Inc. went public, according to Dealogic.
Michael Novogratz, the CEO of Galaxy Digital, warned against interest rate cuts in a strong economy.

"These frenzies rarely last. Gravity comes back into play," Novogratz said.
While he doesn't believe the market is at the top, Novogratz does see signs that things are getting "frothy."
"Markets usually end in one super-spike, some searing frenzy of activity," he said.
Fed could bring on a 'melt-up'
One catalyst for that kind of euphoria could be the Federal Reserve.
President Donald Trump has urged the Fed to slash interest rates by a full-percentage point — a startling move normally reserved for a crisis, not a healthy economy.
"The Fed making a policy error by cutting into a strong economy might lead to a quick melt-up — and that could be the end," Novogratz said.
Billionaire Sam Zell similarly warned on Wednesday of a "disaster" if the Fed listens to Trump by sharply lowering interest rates. Such a move, Zell said, would deal an enormous blow to the US dollar.
The American economy is swimming in jobs. Calling for a rate cut now is bonkers
Stephen Moore, a controversial campaign adviser to Trump, told the SALT audience that it was "so stupid" for the Fed to raise rates last year. Moore, who last week under pressure withdrew his name from consideration to join the Fed, urged the US central bank to swiftly lower rates.
Moore also cheered the Republican tax cuts, saying they worked "even better than we thought they would."
Asked about Moore's comments, Novogratz questioned the wisdom of the administration's decision to "cut taxes into a strong economy" and deepen America's budget deficit.
"I'm glad Stephen Moore is not on the Fed," Novogratz added. US braced for Iranian response as oil crackdown starts "I don't think Iranian oil will stop flowing," said Elizabeth Rosenberg, a former senior adviser at the Treasury Department. While Rosenberg said she expects "a big dip," she emphasized that "it is not going to go to zero. The US has a major enforcement challenge on its hands."
In November, the administration gave eight countries waivers to continue their imports of Iranian crude and condensate: China, India, Turkey, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Greece and Italy. China, India and Turkey reportedly expected to receive extensions when the waivers expired May 2.
The focus on oil exports is the latest step in the administration's "maximum pressure" campaign to create change inside Iran -- an effort some say is more focused on regime change. The intense US focus on Iran has alienated traditional allies in Europe who have stuck to the Iran nuclear deal that Trump abandoned.

And friction over the US approach to Iran could undermine other foreign policy priorities, analysts say, as the White House works to forge tighter ties with India and reach a trade deal with China. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo left no room for compromise, however, when he made the April 22 announcement, taking energy markets by surprise.
"Today I am announcing that we will no longer grant any exemptions," Pompeo told reporters that day. "We're going to zero -- going to zero across the board. We will continue to enforce sanctions and monitor compliance. Any nation or entity interacting with Iran should do its diligence and err on the side of caution. The risks are simply not going to be worth the benefits."
Two days later, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif pushed back at an Asia Society event in New York. "We believe that Iran will continue to sell its oil," he said. "We will continue to find buyers for our oil and we will continue to use the Strait of Hormuz as a safe transit passage for the sale of our oil."
He added a warning. "If the United States takes the crazy measure of trying to prevent us from doing that," Zarif said, "then it should be prepared for the consequences."
US security officials have expressed concern that Tehran could respond asymmetrically by targeting US facilities and personnel around the Middle East.
Cyber response
Henry Rome, an analyst with the Eurasia Group, said their view is that Iran isn't inclined to respond aggressively and instead is hoping to open some form of negotiations with the US or hold out and hope for a successor to Trump.
"If we're wrong and the Iranians do choose to respond to these oil sanctions in an aggressive way, I think the number one threat is through cyber, whether it's taking down a Saudi oil refinery or go after banks in the Middle East, I think that's their most likely route," Rome said. "It provides them a degree of deniability, there's less pressure on President Trump to try to respond, so the risk of escalation is relatively lower."
In the meantime, Iranians are expected to continue smuggling oil, possibly finding routes through Pakistan, Iraq and Afghanistan among other places.
Rome said his group has "baked in 200,000 barrels a day of straight smuggling" -- ship to ship smuggling, as well as countries trying to conceal locations of tankers. "There will be Iranian crude reaching the market after May 2," he said. "It will just be in significantly smaller volumes."

Compared to the Obama administration, "the Trump administration has taken off more Iranian barrels in a short amount of time with less international cooperation," said Rome. But he adds that "the manner in which they did that has been, and will continue to be, highly disruptive to international oil markets and to the bilateral relationships with Iran's main oil importers," he added.
The potential disruption to oil markets may end up contributing to the difficulty of cutting Iran's exports.
Production within the OPEC oil cartel has been disrupted by US sanctions on Venezuela, intensifying conflict inside Libya, and a Saudi decision to cut production, analysts said.
Rosenberg said oil market realities are another reason it will be hard to eliminate Iranian oil exports. "I don't expect it will get to zero, there aren't enough supplies. ... There was not enough notice," said Rosenberg. "The Saudis don't have enough, that is not happening."
Oil prices are an additional wild card, as a slew of factors are already driving domestic US gasoline prices higher -- a "red line" for Trump, the Eurasia Group notes -- just as Americans start the summer holiday driving season.

And then there's the question of whether importing countries will cooperate or try to defy Washington.
"We expect South Korea and Japan to comply fully, to zero out," said Rome.
"We expect China and India to more or less comply" -- but not entirely, Rome added.
"The big difference is we expect both countries to continue importing small volumes of Iranian crude, about 300,000 barrels per day between the two of them," Rome said. "By and large, these countries are more complying than they are defying, but they still do not want to lose face on this and they're sufficiently incentivized to come up with ways to get around this."
Both China and India have made substantial investments in Iran and the arrangement is that they get paid in oil, Rome said, predicting that both countries could argue that their continued acceptance of Iranian oil amounts to Tehran's repayment of a debt and not a contribution to Iran's coffers.
Some countries have made clear they may resist. China and Turkey, Iran's biggest customers, reacted furiously to the announcement that the US would move to plug Iran's energy pipelines.
Opposition
"We do not accept unilateral sanctions and impositions on how we build our relationship with our neighbors," Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in a tweet on April 22, when the US announced its decision. He added that it would undermine regional peace and stability and violated World Trade Organization regulations.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang told reporters on April 22 that his country "opposes the unilateral sanctions and so-called 'long-arm jurisdictions' imposed by the US... Our cooperation with Iran is open, transparent, lawful and legitimate, thus it should be respected," he added.
Rosenberg said that nevertheless, Beijing might seek quiet ways to go around the US, working with smaller companies that aren't connected to the US financial system.
"Those biggest refiners and firms [who do business with Iran] are going to pull back significantly and smaller traders, smaller refiners, with less exposure to US law enforcement will step in and buy Iranian oil," she said, pointing to Chinese companies that have served similar functions in the past. "If they are designated or sanctioned as a practical matter it won't be as significant for them." 'Make Taiwan Great Again': Taiwanese president-hopeful Terry Gou meets Trump "Although it wasn't my first (visit), this time my state of mind was different because I am a Taiwanese presidential candidate," said Gou, who has an estimated net worth of over $7 billion.
Last month, Gou threw his hat in the ring for Taiwan's upcoming presidential race, saying the sea goddess Mazu had told him to "step forward and do something for the people of Taiwan," according to state media.
As well as Mazu, Gou may have been inspired by another source: Trump. According to multiple media reports, the Foxconn chairman is rumored to have been inspired by Trump's 2016 run and began thinking that he too could be a head of state.
Gou's company, Foxconn, is is the world's largest electronics manufacturer, providing parts for Apple, Huawei and others. The Taiwanese company is hugely involved in China, where it employs hundreds of thousands of people. In 2017, it pledged to build a plant in Wisconsin in return for $4 billion in state and local tax incentives, although those plans have since faced harsh criticism.

In a statement, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders called Gou a "brilliant" business leader who was spending a lot of money in Wisconsin -- and would soon announce more investment there.
"The President and Mr Gou did not discuss support for his campaign in Taiwan, he is just a great friend," Saunders said.
In a statement Wednesday, Foxconn said that the two discussed the progress of the Wisconsin Valley Science and Technology Park project, among other matters.
If Gou wins a primary election to be selected as Kuomintang Presidential candidate, he will "withdraw from daily operations" at Foxconn, according to the company. If selected, Gou would likely face off against Taiwan's incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen in the 2020 election, scheduled for January 11. The big winner from Trump's Iran oil boycott: Vladimir Putin With oil exports comprising some 60% of Russia's total merchandise exports and 30% of its GDP, every dollar increase in the price of oil translates immediately into a dramatic improvement in Russia's financial position. This cannot help but offset some of the impact of the sanctions that the United States and Western Europe continue to level on Russia as a result of the Kremlin's seizure of Crimea and its ongoing activities in Eastern Ukraine.
In hard dollar terms, the impact is even more apparent. With Russia producing some 11 million barrels of oil a day, each dollar increase in the price per barrel of crude oil adds at least $4 billion to the Russian economy each year . Moreover, Russia ran a budget surplus last year that was close to 3% of its GDP, higher than forecast, as Russia's Economy Minister Maxim Oreshkin told the Financial Times in December. It was the first such annual budget surplus since 2011.
As it happens, oil prices are one of the few economic indicators that are effectively a zero-sum game. While the oil price increases already anticipated by today's American action may boost Russia's economy, they also add substantially to the burden on America's allies in Western Europe, who consume some 13 million barrels of oil per day.
Oil shoots above $65 on fears about Iran sanctions
Moreover, there are other real threats to the Europe's oil supplies, particularly from the ongoing unrest in Libya, just across the Mediterranean, which had been pumping some 1.2 million barrels a day before the latest unrest, much of it destined for Europe. There are fears that unrest could lead to cutbacks of as much as half that output, further raising oil prices—and again providing another healthy boost to the Russian economy.
At least Russia and China, a leading victim of Monday's Trump embargo action, have been preparing for this day for years. In January 2018, the second Russia-China oil pipeline came online, boosting Russia's capacity to satisfy rapidly expanding Chinese oil requirements—and more cheaply than with a long sea voyage in expensive super-tankers from Iran to the nearest Chinese oil port.
But beyond all these short-term effects of Monday's decision to screw down the hold on Iran even tighter are other black swan impacts that can still be seen on the horizon. These include the ability of large multi-national companies, especially in the oil patch, to forecast accurately the supply-demand-price equations that figure deeply into their decisions to invest or their pricing of products that require large amounts of petroleum. Not to mention any sudden increase in gas prices at the pump as Americans head out for their summer holidays.
Finally, of course, there are any number of geopolitical implications of the United States again dictating the trajectory of the world oil market and the broader economics that are so deeply dependent on this path.

All these are issues that the President should have considered before embarking on this course and that may be far more difficult to undo than to implement. Oil shoots above $65 on fears about Iran sanctions The oil market, however, signaled skepticism.
Oil is up 54% since Christmas Eve lows
US oil prices climbed nearly 3% on Monday to $65.70 a barrel. That represents a spike of 54% since prices closed at $42.53 a barrel on Christmas Eve. Brent crude, the global benchmark, surged nearly 3% on Monday and touched $74 for the first time since early November.
Gasoline prices, meanwhile, continued to climb. The national average hit $2.84 a gallon on Monday, up from $2.61 a month ago, according to AAA.
"It's a bit of a conundrum," said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData, an energy research firm. "We know President Trump wants to keep gasoline prices in check. But oil prices are gaining and that will only drag that retail gasoline price higher."
Iran's oil production has dropped to the lowest level since late 2013, according to the IEA.

Trump first announced sanctions on Iran a year ago. Oil prices initially shot higher due to fears about the loss of supply from Iran, which was then the world's fifth-biggest producer of crude. Saudi Arabia responded by ramping up production to all-time highs.
However, the US administration, fearing an oil shock that would cripple the economy, granted waivers to China, India and six other nations. The softer-than-expected approach left oil markets oversupplied, contributing to last fall's bear market in crude.
The White House announced on Monday that Trump decided he will not reissue the Iran waivers when they expire in early May. The move is aimed at blocking the Iranian regime from its No. 1 source of cash.
"We're going to zero, across the board," US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said during a press conference.
Iran's exports tumble
Iran exported about 1.4 million barrels of crude a day in March, down by half from pre-sanctions levels, according to the International Energy Agency. And Iran's output is sitting at its lowest level in nearly six years, the IEA said.
Some nations have already weaned themselves off Iran's oil. Italy, Greece and Taiwan haven't loaded any Iranian barrels since November, the IEA said, citing Kpler shipping data.
However, China, Japan, Korea and Turkey have imported more oil from Iran than their waivers allowed them to, the IEA said.
"It's hard to see the exports go to zero. But you may roughly lose about half of it," said Matt Sallee, portfolio manager at energy investment firm Tortoise. He said China is unlikely to completely cease imports from Iran.
Trump administration announces all countries importing Iranian oil will be subject to US sanctions
The good news for American drivers is that the United States is pumping more oil than ever before. In fact, America is now the world's leading oil producer.
That domestic production, which is expected to keep rising, provides a cushion against the situations in Iran and Venezuela.
"The United States is now a significant producer," Pompeo said on Monday.
However, not all crude is created equally. US shale oil is much lighter than the heavy barrels knocked offline in Iran and Venezuela. US Gulf Coast refineries are configured to run on a healthy dose of heavy crude. A shortage of those heavy barrels would make it difficult for refiners to produce as much gasoline, diesel and jet fuel as America's economy requires.
Saudis voice support
The Trump administration announced on Monday that the United States, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are "committed to ensuring that global oil markets remain adequately supplied."
"We have agreed to take timely action to assure that global demand is met," the White House said in a statement.
However, no specifics were announced. Pompeo declined to go into details on any such agreement.
Khalid al-Falih, Saudi Arabia's energy minister, said in a separate statement that the kingdom will coordinate with other oil producers "to ensure the availability of enough oil supplies for consumers and to ensure global oil markets are not knocked off balance."
The end of the OPEC deal?
If Saudi Arabia wants to help, it would have to reverse its own recent moves.
Facing a collapse in oil prices, OPEC and its allies agreed in December to slash production. Saudi Arabia, OPEC's de facto leader, delivered the brunt of the output cuts.
There's trouble in OPEC and oil prices are up 50%
Nasseri, the analyst from Facts Global Energy, said that Saudi Arabia and the UAE could potentially replace up to 1 million barrels per day lost because of the crackdown on Iran.
However, such a move would eat into the ability of Saudi Arabia and the UAE to respond to future supply shocks.
"They will end up having very little spare capacity left for any other emergency or any other crisis in the oil market," Nasseri said.
US imports from Venezuela have plunged to zero because of the sanctions Trump imposed earlier this year on PDVSA, the Latin American nation's state-owned oil company.
OPEC and its allies will need to decide next steps when they meet in Vienna in June.
"They will have a very tough OPEC meeting," Nasseri said. "That may be the end of the OPEC-plus agreement in its current format." Xi Jinping is determined to end all poverty in China by 2020. Can he do it? Stills from the Gaibao village's Kuaishou page, where they raise money through videos of their everyday lives.
{"@context": "http://schema.org","@type": "ImageObject","name": "Stills from the Gaibao village&#39;s Kuaishou page, where they raise money through videos of their everyday lives.","description": "Stills from the Gaibao village&#39;s Kuaishou page, where they raise money through videos of their everyday lives.","url": "//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190416135256-01-poverty-alleviation-video-large-169.jpg",}
The idea to stream videos of the village came from Gaibao's chief poverty alleviation official, Wu Yusheng, and has helped the town, in the province of Guizhou, sell its organic produce online.
Residents also receive virtual gifts from fans via the app, which they can exchange for cash.
Wu, who arrived in the village in 2018, said he had already achieved his goal -- but it is unclear whether Xi will do the same.
At worst, some experts fear the ruling Communist Party might just announce poverty has been eradicated, regardless of the reality, to avoid embarrassing Xi.
"Local leaders are taking it extremely seriously, almost in a panicky way. Part of the problem is that they don't know really what to do, so they're kind of grasping at different solutions," said John Donaldson, a poverty expert and associate professor at Singapore Management University. "They're throwing everything at it."

The campaign against poverty
The dream of eradicating widespread poverty in China didn't begin with Xi. It dates back to the Communist Party's rise to power in 1949. "The reason for the existence of the Chinese Communist Party in the beginning is because of injustice and poverty among farmers," Donaldson said.
Chairman Mao Zedong's economic experiments, however, actually set the country back, according to Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the University of London.
"In 1949, Shanghai was still a richer city than Hong Kong. In 1949, any coastal province was richer and more developed than Taiwan. In 1979, Hong Kong and Taiwan were way, way ahead," Tsang said.
Mao's disastrous Great Leap Forward, beginning in 1958, was ostensibly an attempt to transform a mainly agrarian society through industrialization and collectivization. Instead, it helped create a famine that cost tens of millions of lives and aggravated poverty across the country.
Things began to change after Mao's death. In 1978, then-paramount leader Deng Xiaoping began liberalizing China's economy and one of his first reforms was to let struggling farmers sell excess produce to make a profit.

China's efforts to combat poverty since then have been staggering. In 1990, there were more than 750 million people living in poverty across the nation, according to the World Bank -- over 60% of the population. Almost 30 years later in 2019, Beijing says that number has dropped to just 16.6 million.
One of the Communist Party's main claims to power in recent years has been that it has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty.
Perhaps for that reason, Xi still isn't satisfied. Despite the growing wealth of China's major cities such as Shanghai or Beijing, parts of rural China live without electricity, fresh water and adequate food or clothing.
In his 2015 speech, Xi said he was inspired to make poverty a priority by his experience working in the countryside in the 1960s when his father, a prominent party official, fell from favor during Mao's Cultural Revolution.
"I toiled with the villagers at the time, with the aim to make life a bit better, but it was harder than reaching the sky in that year," he said.

Roads, internet and jobs
The government's plan is broadly divided into two strategies -- big national policies and small local interventions.
At a national level, the policies revolve around infrastructure spending. Xi's administration is pouring billions of dollars into the problem, $19 billion in 2019 alone, which has been spent on a variety of projects and initiatives across the country.
More than 200,000 kilometers (124,274 miles) of roads were built or renovated in 2018 and 94% of poor villages were connected to the internet, according to government figures.
Dozens of state-owned enterprises have joined the campaign and poured more than $4 billion (30 billion yuan) into poverty relief programs as of early 2019, according to state media.
Some of these big-ticket projects have sparked controversy. A number of provincial governments have been accused of trying to simply move millions of poor people to newly built urban accommodation to raise them out of poverty.
Some older rural citizens have refused to go, while others have moved but then returned to their old homes. Maggie Lau, a professor at Hong Kong's Lingnan University, said such schemes aren't always pragmatic. "If they move to a higher-cost area, how can they afford those new living costs?" she asks.

But to a large degree, the anti-poverty campaign is small-scale and has been left in the hands of local officials.
"Every local official on a township level (one above a village) goes down to every poor household and tries to find out what's going on and why people are poor and how to apply resources to that," Donaldson said, describing his observations in Chinese villages.
The solutions proposed vary wildly but often focus on encouraging villagers to lift themselves out of poverty by developing local industries, engaging in e-commerce and boosting rural tourism.
While Donaldson said the effort expended was "amazing," problems emerged with government officials spending too much time just knocking on doors talking about poverty rather than tackling local problems. "The danger is that it will be a confused mess," he said.
There has also been a lack of patience with poor villagers who fail to get with the program.
In a report in February, Wu Weihua, a vice chairman of the national legislature, complained that some people just don't want to "get rich."
"Some poor people even have the mindset of, 'You don't help, I don't move'," the report said.

China's senior citizens risk being left behind 02:44
Corruption and pollution
Failure is not tolerated -- and the government is watching where its money is being spent.
In March 2018, a provincial governor was kicked out of the Communist Party, partly for his failure to address poverty in his jurisdiction. In October that year, inspections were carried out in provinces across central and western China to check that officials were following orders on poverty alleviation.
The flood of government and company funds allocated to deal with the issue has also revived the ever-present threat of corruption. More than 170,000 individuals were disciplined in 2018 alone for misappropriation of poverty alleviation funds, according to the party's anti-graft agency Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.
There have also been signs that the government's laser-like focus on poverty is impeding another of its main goals -- environmental conservation.
A 2015 research paper found evidence that work by the government to eradicate poverty by boosting the economy was lowering air and water quality in affected regions.
Heavily polluting industries were encouraged to set up shop, bringing jobs and prosperity at the expense of the environment. Or natural resources were exploited for financial gain.
"Economic growth, poverty alleviation and ecological degradation do not appear to have de-coupled as required for long-term sustainable use of the environment, especially with regards to food security and access to clean water," the joint British and Chinese study said.
Some critics also note that the government has focused mainly on poverty in the countryside rather than in cities, ignoring less severe but still-pressing urban hardship.
'Absolutely confident'
Wu, the Guizhou village poverty alleviation chief, said he was "absolutely confident" the 2020 goal could be met.
"The government is doing everything to achieve that. And on the micro level, the targeting of poverty population is really precise. It's not a problem if the entire society is making an effort," he said.
China's Xi Jinping begins his most important year at his weakest point
But experts and international observers say China's poverty goals achieve the bare minimum -- more work will be needed in the cities and the countryside to ensure everyone enjoys a high quality of life.
Qin Gao, director of Columbia University's China Center for Social Policy, said in a 2018 report that broader government support for healthcare and employment would be more useful than initiatives on an individual basis or e-commerce measures.
"Only a combination of effective development measures and social policies and services can help China eradicate persisting rural poverty in the long run," she said.
But Donaldson said that even if the target is met in 2020, he didn't believe the government would just abandon poverty as an issue.
"Any kind of responsible government would be focused on how you help improve the living standards of people who may not be poor but are still struggling," he said. "I expect that to be on the agenda of the party forever." A goddess inspired a Taiwanese billionaire to follow Trump's example Tsai announced her intention to run in February this year, after bruising local election losses in 2018 saw her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) hemorrhaging votes island-wide.
The DPP has traditionally favored moves toward formalizing Taiwan's de facto independence from China. Since she took power in 2016, Tsai has attempted to diversify the island's economy from being too dependent on its large neighbor, while pushing back against what she views as Beijing's aggressive expansionism.
In turn, Beijing has ramped up pressure on Taiwan, conducting large scale military drills around the island, including sailing the Liaoning aircraft carrier through the Taiwan Strait. Speaking in January, Chinese President Xi Jinping urged Taiwan to embrace "peaceful reunification" with China, saying that independence was a "dead end."
Should he become president, Gou will likely be challenged with repairing this relationship, while maintaining Taiwan's traditionally strong ties with Washington.
He will have a better claim than many candidates for being able to do so -- Foxconn has made billions through deep involvement in the Chinese economy, where many of its manufacturing plants are based, producing electronics for many American tech companies, most notably Apple.
Gou himself also has strong ties to the United States, and has met US President Donald Trump, who has called him "a friend of mine" and "one of the most successful businessmen in the world."
The People's Daily, a mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, said on Wednesday that "Gou has a unique advantage in dealing with the relations between Taiwan and Mainland, and the US."
Taiwan will elect its next President on January 11, 2020.

Blessings from a goddess
Gou announced his candidacy this week after visiting a temple in Taipei dedicated to the Taoist deity Mazu, guardian angel of seafarers.
Wearing a bright red vest and a baseball cap showing the flag of the Republic of China -- the official name for Taiwan -- Gou said that Mazu had given her blessing to his candidacy.
"If Mazu says that you should step up, it is not in order to make money or for personal enjoyment," Gou told reporters. "I tell you, I am like a godson to Mazu ... I will definitely respect and follow Mazu's will."
Speaking later at KMT headquarters -- still wearing his cap -- Gou said he was "willing to participate in the primary elections."
"I am not willing to accept being appointed (without being elected), I am definitely not willing to accept being appointed. If elected, I will represent the Kuomintang in the 2020 contest," he said. "If I am not elected, it means that I didn't try hard enough."
In a statement, Foxconn said Gou would only run for president, "if the primary process - which is still being determined by party leadership - is open, transparent, and grounded."
"When and if this determination is made, Mr. Gou will run in the KMT's primary to seek the party nomination for President," a spokeswoman said.
A statue of the goddess Mazu (front) is displayed in Jenn Lann Temple following its return after being carried in a sedan chair on the nine day Mazu pilgrimage on April 23, 2018 in Dajia near Taichung, Taiwan.

As well as Mazu, Gou may have been inspired by another source: Trump. According to multiple media reports, the Foxconn chairman is rumored to have been inspired by Trump's 2016 run and began thinking that he too could be President.
Margaret Lewis, a Taiwan expert at the Seton Hall University School of Law, compared Gou's candidacy to Trump's, and warned against underestimating the Taiwanese billionaire.
"Even though he's obviously flawed in many ways as a candidate, populism can be powerful," she said. "It would be a mistake to treat his run too lightly."
While Gou is definitely an outsider candidate -- according to state media, he hasn't been a KMT member since 2000 -- he's received backing from key party figures, with former leader and President of Taiwan, Ma Ying-jeou, saying he was "an ideal candidate."
Lev Nachman, an expert on Taiwanese politics at the University of California, Irvine, said that Gou had one thing in particular that the KMT needs: Funding.
"Terry Gou is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Taiwan and would essentially be able to finance his own campaign," he said. "That's a big deal for the KMT right now."
Supporters celebrate at DPP headquarters as Tsai Ing-wen declares her victory in Taiwan's 2016 presidential election.

Support from Beijing?
Despite once fighting a civil war with the Communist Party for rule over China -- before defeat forced the Republic of China government to retreat to Taiwan -- the KMT has in recent decades been the party of closer ties and engagement with Beijing.
Former President Ma held historic talks with China's Xi in 2015, and his administration massively ramped up cross-straits economic activity, including a controversial trade deal that sparked mass protests known as the Sunflower Movement, which are credited with helping carry Tsai and her DPP to the presidency.
Gou's connections to China are manifold. His company Foxconn employs hundreds of thousands of people in factories and manufacturing plants across China.
"Gou is an integral player in the Chinese economy and becoming president would put him in a position to very closely tie Taiwan into China's economy in ways Tsai has fought against such as her New Southbound Policy which tried to extend Taiwan's trade beyond just China," Nachman said.
Foxconn could also be a potential concern for voters, however.
So far, the company has been tight-lipped over what a Gou run for president will exactly mean for his relations with the company he founded.
A spokeswoman said that at present Gou remains chairman, and would "continue to provide strategic direction and guidance," as he seeks the KMT nomination.
"That's the million dollar question. Who is Gou loyal to? Taiwan? Foxconn? Both? If the answer is Foxconn or both, that puts Taiwan in a bad position with Gou as president because Foxconn's success is tied to, coercively or not, the Chinese state," Nachman said.
"In the same way Trump only marginally divested from his assets when he became president, I would not expect Gou to truly move away from his (company)," he added.
"I would be greatly concerned with Gou's ability to separate his business from his political endeavors. Given Foxconn's position within the Chinese economy and Gou's political ideals, I'm not sure he even can or wants to."
Lewis, the Seton Hall professor, also cautioned against assuming that Gou -- or any other KMT President -- would be able to magically fix relations with Beijing.
"Ma Ying-jeou met with Xi Jinping, but I don't think it's fair to compare the Xi Jinping of 2015 with the Xi Jinping of 2019," she said. "He's been able to take on a more assertive position in recent years."

Taiwan's president discusses relationship with US 08:00
Can he win?
Gou has said repeatedly that he does not want to be simply anointed as KMT candidate, and will fight the party's primary.
This could be a close run for the billionaire, with multiple other candidates and potential candidates, including Han Kuo-yu, who Gou himself previously said would be a "terrific" president.
Han, a hugely popular KMT mayor of the southern city of Kaohsiung, has not officially announced his candidacy, but had been seen in recent weeks as frontrunner to be the party's eventual pick. He recently toured the US, meeting with lawmakers and business leaders, a traditional first step to declaring a run for president.
"Han Kuo-yu is a very interesting, unusual person," Lewis said. "He has has not set forth clear policies, going with a much more flashy, 'I'm something different even if you don't know what that is' approach."
As Kaohsiung mayor, Han has increased engagement with China, and would be expected to follow a similar path to Gou's, which Lewis described as a "general willingness to engage with China, particularly economically, and a belief that engagement can be confined to the economic."
"Han does currently have an unmatched level of popularity in Taiwan right now," Nachman said. "Han has also shown, especially during his most recent trip to Hong Kong, that he, like Gou, is willing to build strong connections to the CCP and push for a more pro-unification agenda."
With both Gou and Han favoring closer ties with China, Nachman said there was even a small possibility they could end up working together, on a ticket that could dramatically reshape politics both within the KMT and Taiwan at large.
"That would be the most blatantly pro-unification team to ever be seriously considered for presidential leadership," he said. "It could very much lead to the end of the current status quo as we know it." 30 years after Tiananmen massacre, Taiwan shows another way for China For decades, the Nationalist Party (KMT) whose soldiers carried out the 2/28 massacre prevented official investigation of the bloodshed. The size of the death toll thus remains uncertain, though it is believed to be between several thousand and 25,000.
In 1977, 30 years after 2/28, the KMT continued to ban all discussion of the event.

1989: Man vs. tank in Tiananmen square 02:55
Two governments, two massacres
In 1977, Taiwan was still, like today's PRC, under one-party authoritarian rule.
A key reason the memories of the 1947 massacre threatened the KMT in 1977 and memories of the 1989 massacre threaten the CCP now is that, in each killing, soldiers touted as benevolent defenders of the people behaved like brutal invaders.
Today however, Taiwan is a democracy, and 2/28 is marked nationwide as Peace Memorial Day. What can we learn from the similarities between the massacres -- and that the KMT eventually apologized for 2/28?
After Japan's 1945 surrender in World War II, Chiang Kai-shek's forces seized Taiwan and claimed it for the ROC, which then included much of the territory of today's PRC. Heavy-handed efforts to subdue the island by Chiang's KMT were, not surprisingly, met with resistance. Tensions flared on February 27, 1947, when police struck a widow who was selling cigarettes illegally. Big protests broke out. The next day KMT soldiers fired on crowds.
Chiang's government denied that a massacre had occurred and stuck to this position long after Mao Zedong's forces drove the KMT from the Chinese mainland.
On the 30th anniversary of the massacre, a public reckoning with the event seemed no more likely than a full investigation into Tiananmen does today. But that changed.

Decoding the China-Taiwan relationship 02:24
Taiwan's past, China's future
Even though only one of the massacres can be openly discussed in the place in which it occurred, there are three ways in which thinking about 2/28's legacy helps put that of 6/4 into perspective.
First, by showing that the histories of authoritarian systems often take unexpected turns.
Hopes for a long-term relaxation of repression in the PRC have proved chimerical. The CCP has been remarkably resilient. But Taiwan's case reminds us that even resilient objects break.
The ROC was under martial law for decades. As late as 1979, the KMT used force to crush pro-democracy protesters in Kaohsiung, Taiwan's second biggest city. In the 1980s, however, democracy activists asserted themselves with a vigor that took many observers by surprise, and, in 1986, Chiang Ching-kuo, Chiang Kai-shek's son and successor, unexpectedly reversed his father's policies and allowed for formal establishment of an opposition party. Martial law eventually ended in 1987.
Second, multiple forces can drive change.
Political activists, long-time officials, and other actors played important roles in Taiwan's democratization. This suggests the need to avoid letting PRC President Xi Jinping's current emphasis on control engender myopia. Even when a confident strongman is on top, it is worth keeping an eye out for forces bubbling under the surface.
Third, change is a long slog.
It's worth remembering that the ROC did not have its first direct presidential election until 1996. And its first non-KMT President was not elected until 2000.
Taiwan's history does not tell us what will happen in the PRC in the near future, but it does give us reason to hope that policies -- including how 6/4 is remembered and discussed -- can eventually change.
The question that remains is how, and when? Federal prosecutors say woman illegally entered Trump's Mar-a-Lago club After agents were alerted to Zhang's presence, she told them she was there to attend a "United Nations Friendship Event"between the United States and China, and produced what she claimed was an invitation to the event, the complaint says. But "agents were unable to read it as it was in Chinese." No such event was scheduled to take place on the property at that time.
Trump was staying at Mar-a-Lago on that date, though he was not on the property at the time of Zhang's alleged visit.
After she was detained, agents found she had multiple electronic devices including four cellphones, a laptop computer, an external "hard drive type" device and a thumb drive.
A preliminary investigation found malicious malware on the thumb drive, prosecutors say.
Late Tuesday, US Attorney's office spokeswoman Sarah Schall said the two passports Zhang was carrying were from the People's Republic of China. The complaint had indicated they were from the Republic of China, commonly known as Taiwan.
"Information presented to the court indicates that the defendant is from the People's Republic of China, not Republic of China (Taiwan), and they were PRC passports," Schall said in an email.
When asked about the incident Wednesday, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang said he had "no information" on Zhang's arrest.
The complaint raises numerous questions about Zhang's purpose on the property. When agents interviewed her, she"claimed her Chinese friend 'Charles' told her to travel from Shanghai, China, to Palm Beach, Florida, to attend this event and attempt to speak with a member of the President's family about Chinese and American foreign economic relations," according to the complaint.
Agents tried to find out more about "Charles," but Zhang claimed she had contact with him only through WeChat, a messaging service that is popular in China.
"Due to a potential language barrier issue," the complaint says, Mar-a-Lago believed her to be a relative of a member.
But during the interviews with agents, the complaint states, she "exhibited a detailed knowledge of, and ability to converse in and understand even subtle nuances of, the English language."
"For example, as agents were attempting to obtain written consent for examination of electronic devices found in her possession, Zhang read the entire form in English out loud to agents," it says.
Prosecutors in the Southern District of Florida charged her Monday with one count of making a false statement to a federal officer and one count of entering restricted property.
Zhang made a brief initial appearance in Florida federal court Monday where she was advised of the charges against her and the possible penalties she faced. She is due back in court for a detention hearing on April 8.
In a statement late Tuesday, the US Secret Service said Mar-a-Lago club management is responsible for deciding who is allowed access to the property, noting that "this access does not afford an individual proximity to the President or other Secret Service protectees."
"While the Secret Service does not determine who is permitted to enter the club, our agents and officers conduct physical screenings to ensure no prohibited items are allowed onto the property," the statement said.
It added that "with the exception of certain permanently protected facilities, such as the White House, the practice used at Mar-a-Lago is no different than that long-used at any other site temporarily visited by the President or other Secret Service protectees.
Correction: This story has been updated to clarify Mar-a-Lago staff admitted Zhang to the property and that Zhang told Mar-a-Lago staff she was there to attend a United Nations Chinese American Association event, according to the criminal complaint. The complaint also states that Mar-a-Lago staff, not the Secret Service, believed Zhang was related to a club member.
This story was also updated to correct the attribution of the country of the passports Zhang was carrying. Philippines protests hundreds of Chinese ships around disputed island China's ambassador to the Philippines, Zhao Jianhua, said Beijing was trying to verify how many vessels were around Thitu. They might be "unarmed" fishing vessels, he said, according to CNN Philippines.
Thitu island is in the disputed Spratlys chain, which includes Chinese-controlled atolls and reefs that Beijing has built up and developed with buildings, ports and runways over the past several years.
Philippines opposition lawmaker Gary Alejano said Saturday that the Duterte administration should not let China establish any long-term presence around Thitu.
"China is establishing a norm there which we cannot alter later on. Every day is a wasted opportunity to assert our sovereignty if we do not act now," he said, according to CNN Philippines.

What's going on in the South China Sea? 03:15
Besides the Philippines, China, Taiwan and Vietnam have also laid claim to Thitu. It has a civilian population of more than 100, as well as some military personnel, according to the Asian Maritime Transparency Initiative.
The island is about 500 kilometers (310 miles) from Palawan, one of the main Philippine islands, which will be hosting exercises between the US and Philippine militaries in the next two weeks.
Philippines warns US treaty could drag it into war
Manila has been in an awkward dance between Beijing and Washington for years over the South China Sea.
Under the previous government of Benigno Aquino, Manila won a landmark case against China at an international tribunal, which ruled that many of Beijing's territorial claims in the South China Sea were unlawful.
However, the administration under current President Rodrigo Duterte has moved closer to Beijing, even as the president voiced concerns about China's territorial ambitions. Taiwan scrambles jets to confront Chinese fighters after rare incursion She said there was one instance in 2011 when Chinese planes accidentally crossed the line.
var id = '//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js'.replace(/\s+/g, '');!!document.getElementById(id) || (function makeEmbedScript(d, id) {var js,fjs;js = d.createElement('script');js.id = id;js.charset = 'utf-8';js.setAttribute('async', '');fjs = d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);js.src = '//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';}(document, id));
According to local Taiwan media, the Sunday incident triggered a 10-minute standoff between jets from the two sides.
China and Taiwan have been separately governed since the end of a brutal civil war in 1949. Beijing views the self-governed island as part of its territory.
Weekend activities
On Saturday, the Japanese Self-Defense Force announced it had also scrambled fighters after the Chinese air force flew between Japan's islands of Okinawa and Miyako.
Japan's Self Defense Forces said in a statement the Chinese air force had sent four Xian H-6K long range bombers, one Shaanxi Y-8 electronic countermeasures aircraft, one Tupolev Tu-154 MD electronic intelligence plane and at least two fighter jets through international airspace between Japanese islands on Saturday.

It isn't the first time China has flown planes over the Miyako Strait -- in March 2018, it conducted drills with bombers and fighter jets in the same area
In the past 12-months China's military has ramped up the number of drills and exercises it conducts around Taiwan, including sailing the aircraft carrier Liaoning through the strait.
Taiwan wants to buy advanced jets and tanks from the US
In a speech in January, Chinese President Xi Jinping said Taiwan independence was a "dead end," warning he didn't rule out force as a method of reunification.
Speaking on Wednesday, Taiwan President Tsai said her government had submitted a request to buy new F-16 fighters and M1 heavy tanks from the United States, which she said would "greatly enhance" the island's defense capabilities.
The Chinese government has yet to respond to statements made by Japan or Taiwan, but in a press conference last Thursday, Ministry of Defense spokesman Wu Qian said potential US sales to Taiwan were "dangerous."
"We will strive for peaceful reunification with utmost sincerity and greatest efforts. However ... we will take all necessary measure to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity and protect peace and stability across the strait," he said. New Zealand's special relationship with China is on the rocks. Can Jacinda Ardern's Beijing trip save it? But Jason Young, director of the New Zealand Contemporary China Research Center, said over the past few years more and more issues have come between the two countries.
"Some of those issues are due to how China itself has changed," he said.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key (L) shakes hands with Chinese President Hu Jintao during their meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on April 14, 2009.

Growing tensions
The China-New Zealand relationship is one that Ardern's predecessors have taken care to foster.
Key visited the country six times during his eight years as leader. Under Prime Minister Helen Clark, New Zealand in 2008 became the first developed country to sign a free-trade agreement with China.
Today, China is New Zealand's largest trading partner. Two-way trade between the countries was valued at more than $19 billion (28 billion New Zealand dollars) in 2018, according to New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade. China is also New Zealand's second-largest tourism market and largest source of international students.
New Zealand PM denies rift with China after Huawei ban
However Wellington's ties to Beijing have raised alarm bells with the United States, New Zealand's longtime ally.
Along with Washington, New Zealand is a member of the exclusive intelligence sharing community known as "Five Eyes," which also consists of the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia.
In an extraordinary statement to the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission in April 2018, former US government analyst Peter Mattis said New Zealand's membership should be reviewed given its relationship with Beijing.
"Australia and New Zealand both face substantial problems with interference by the Chinese Communist Party. In both cases, the CCP has gotten very close to or inside the political core, if you will, of both countries," Mattis told the commission.
Juggling the relationship with the US and China has become increasingly difficult for New Zealand, with relations between the two giants souring amid US President Donald Trump's escalating trade war.
Tensions with Beijing reached a new level in 2018 when New Zealand's Government Communications Security Bureau blocked Chinese technology company Huawei from providing 5G technology to one of the country's major telecommunication companies, Spark.
The US has been putting pressure on its allies and diplomatic partners to ditch Huawei over security concerns, a move which has been regularly condemned by Beijing.
Speaking to CNN in February, Andrew Campbell, a spokesman for Ardern, said the relationship had suffered some "irritation ... because of the GCSB's decision regarding Huawei."
When asked whether Huawei would be on the agenda this weekend, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang evaded the question.
Ardern on the back foot
In recent months, Ardern has found herself under greater pressure from opposition politicians and critics to defend the strength of New Zealand's relationship with China.
In February, Ardern was forced to deny that China was deliberately dragging out the visa process for New Zealander diplomats and postponing trips by officials to Beijing.
The same month, local media reported an Air New Zealand flight to Shanghai was mysteriously forced to turn back to Auckland on discovering that its paperwork referred to the disputed island of Taiwan.
At the time, Ardern denied it was a "relationship" issue with China, saying instead it was an administrative error.
But the postponement of a major Chinese-New Zealand tourism event that same month -- which Ardern put down to a scheduling issue -- also added to speculation of a rift.
Ardern's trip also comes at a sensitive time for New Zealand, just two weeks after the terrorist attack against two mosques in Christchurch in which 50 people died. She even said she would be cutting her trip to China short, as it didn't seem "appropriate" to be overseas at such a time.
Following global praise for her handling of the tragedy, the New Zealand leader has come under pressure from human rights group to raise the issue of China's crackdown on Uyghur Muslims with Xi. Up to two million Uyghurs have reportedly been detained in detention centers in the western region of Xinjiang, according to US government reports.
"Given I've raised it before, that should give you an indication," she said when asked by reporters this week.
Prior to her trip, a spokesman for the Prime Minister denied again that she was concerned about the relationship with China worsening under her leadership. "China is one of our most important and far-reaching relationships. Our relationship is mature and resilient," the spokesman said.
China researcher Young agreed with the official line.
"I think if the relationship really was deteriorating in that way, then it would be far clearer. I think China would be a lot more blunt in the message if it was wanting to send a message," he said.
Chinese billionaire stripped of visa calls Australia 'a giant baby'
Wider strains
Increasingly, the Pacific -- a region where New Zealand has long been a significant player -- is shaping up to be a new battleground for influence.
China has promised billions of dollars of aid and support in the region and, if it follows through, could overtake Australia as the biggest donor to the Pacific nations.
China could overtake Australia as biggest donor to Pacific, if it pays up
New Zealand has also been ramping up spending. Last year, the government announced it would boost aid in the region by 714 million New Zealand dollars ($484 million) as part of its "Pacific Reset" strategy -- a move commentators said was at least partly driven by China's growing influence in the area.
"Our eyes are wide open to New Zealand's decreasing influence in the Pacific and we are committed to resetting our approach to working with the Pacific," Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters said in June last year.
Despite the numerous points of friction, Stephen Jacobi, the executive director of the New Zealand China Council, isn't panicking. Instead, Jacobi said, the biggest fear is that tiny New Zealand becomes irrelevant.
"The reality is we are a small country and the Chinese don't get up every day thinking about how they can do nice things for New Zealand," he said. "That means we need to be careful in the way we do things -- but we are never going to agree on everything with China." Taiwan wants to buy advanced jets and tanks from the US In response, China's Defense Ministry said Beijing was "firmly opposed to US arms sales to Taiwan and US military contact with Taiwan."
"The Taiwan issue belongs to China's internal affairs, concerns China's core interest and the national bond of the Chinese people -- it allows no outside interference," spokesman Wu Qian said.
"Such dangerous moves aren't in the interest of either side."

US Navy plane warned off by Chinese military 01:06
'Aggressive approach'
Cross-strait tensions have been on the rise in recent years, as Beijing attempts to pressure Taiwan over what it fears is growing support for independence on the self-ruled island.
Taiwan has been de facto independent from mainland China since the end of the country's civil war in 1949 when the losing nationalist government fled to Taipei. China's Communist Party has always maintained that Taiwan is part of its territory and vowed to pursue reunification, vacillating between building economic and social ties with the island and threatening it militarily.
In her New Year's address, Tsai called on Beijing to "face the reality of the existence of the Republic of China," referring to the island by its official name. She also urged Beijing to "respect the commitment of the 23 million people of Taiwan to freedom and democracy."
The following day, Xi called Taiwan independence "a dead end" and encouraged the island to follow the "one country, two systems" model adopted in Hong Kong when it moved from British to Chinese control in 1997.
Tsai said earlier this week that Taiwan "absolutely will not accept the 'one country, two systems' model."
She took a forceful tone Wednesday, saying Taipei would take an "aggressive approach to counteract the Chinese government's infiltration of our society and economy, as well as their interference in our domestic affairs."
"They have continued to undermine our democratic institutions, heighten military tensions and degrade our international space. This has led to growing distrust by the people of Taiwan, posing an underlying challenge to the future of cross-strait relations," she said. "China's actions have underscored the need for Taiwan to increase our self-defense and deterrence capabilities." US sails two ships through Taiwan Strait ahead of trade talks in Beijing The approximately 110-mile-wide strait, which separates the People's Republic of China and Taiwan, is seen as a potential geopolitical flashpoint should Beijing ever seek to take the island of Taiwan by force.
Beijing continues to lay claim to Taiwan, a self-governed, democratic island that China views as a breakaway province. The two have been separated since the end of a bloody civil war in 1949.
While the strait constitutes international waters, China is thought to be very sensitive about the presence of US military forces there.
In an exclusive interview with CNN last month, Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen said the military threat posed by China was growing "every day" in line with a more assertive foreign policy under its President Xi Jinping.
While the US does not formally recognize Taiwan as an independent country it does maintain close relations with the island, a relationship defined by the Taiwan Relations act which was signed into law by President Jimmy Carter in April of 1979.
The act says that "the United States will make available to Taiwan such defense articles and defense services in such quantity as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capabilities," and the US has sold Taiwan a series of arms packages over the years, sales that are strongly protested by Beijing.
Trump administration officials have hinted that additional arms sales to Taiwan could soon take place.
Peter Navarro wrote in an op-ed in the New York Times last week that, "Taiwan may soon buy 108 Abrams tanks" and other officials have said that Taiwan could soon announce plans to purchase F-16 fighter jets.
Observers see both sets of military equipment as likely to anger Beijing.
The transit also comes the day after the White House announced that US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin would travel to China in an effort to resolve a long running trade dispute.
"Principal-level meetings starting on March 28 to continue negotiations aimed at improving the trade relationship between the United States and China," White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement Saturday. Jon Huntsman Fast Facts Mother: Karen (Haight) Huntsman

China's military is going from strength to strength under Xi Jinping While the Chinese military may be one of the world's best-funded armed forces, its budget still pales in comparison to United States. In December, US President Donald Trump agreed to increase the defense budget funding to $750 billion in 2019.
The US Navy still dominates the world's oceans too, far outpacing China in its logistical capabilities and international reach.
But Beijing is rapidly gaining ground on its American rival, by churning out naval vessels and making technological advances, according to Andrew Erickson, professor of strategy at the US Naval War College's China Maritime Studies Institute.
"No one has presided over this level of Chinese military development in Chinese history before Xi Jinping," he said.

'Armed forces to be reckoned with'
Directly comparing every aspect of two countries' military budgets is impossible, said Erickson, because different governments count spending in different ways.
But the US expert said it was incontrovertible that China's military budget was the second largest in the world.
"Clearly, overall, these are armed forces to be reckoned with. In many areas, they have weapons systems that only a few other countries possess," he said.
China closer to equipping warships with electromagnetic railguns, state media reports
"If you look where China's military was a few short years ago, under Xi the progress is truly tremendous. It is very impressive."
The signs of a push to modernize the military are everywhere. Between 2016 and 2017, 32 new ships were commissioned by the PLA, according to US government reports. In comparison, the US commissioned 13.
Since 2014, China has launched more submarines, warships, principal amphibious vessels and auxiliaries than the total number of ships currently serving in the navies of Germany, India, Spain, Taiwan and the United Kingdom, according to a 2018 report by think tank IISS.
"China's navy is receiving warships so quickly that Chinese sources liken this to dumping dumplings into soup broth," Erickson said.
The Chinese air force has also been regularly debuting new and improved planes and weapons, including the twin-engine J-20 stealth fighter.

China shows off new J-20 stealth fighter (2016) 00:48
Beijing's air force is now the largest in Asia and the third largest in the world, according to the US Defense Department, and is closing the gap with the US "across a spectrum of capabilities."
At the same time, Xi has also begun a reorganization of military personnel, stressing quality and effectiveness over quantity of staff. In 2017, Xi streamlined the powerful Central Military Commission, which he leads, reducing the number of members and solidifying his control.
Multiple former generals have been disciplined or imprisoned for corruption in an attempt to professionalize the armed services.
Aircraft carriers and corvettes
While the military strengths of the US and China are often compared, the two governments ostensibly have built their armed forces to serve different goals.
Washington says it aims to maintain a worldwide reach for its military to protect allies and American interests internationally.
Beijing claims its interests lie closer to home.
US warships again challenge Beijing's claims in South China Sea
Zhang Yesui, the National People's Congress spokesman, on Monday afternoon told reporters: "China's limited defense spending, which is for safeguarding its national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity, poses no threat to any other country.
"Whether a country is a military threat to others or not is not determined by its increase in defense expenditure, but by the foreign and national defense policies it adopts."
The major scenarios that China's military cares about could be called "home games, rather than away games," Erickson said.
The Chinese government has built a navy and armed forces designed to protect the country and exert its influence in the surrounding region, especially the East and South China seas.
The proof is in the military hardware that the two countries have focused on.
While the US has a huge fleet of 12 nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, China has barely one conventionally powered carrier operating, with another in the wings. The Type 001A, the country's first homegrown aircraft carrier, was launched in 2018 but still has not joined the fleet.
Xi Jinping's global dreams hit a wall amid growing backlash against China
Beijing has, however, rapidly produced Jiangdao-class corvettes, a small warship generally best suited to fighting close to home. A US Department of Defense report in 2018 said this move was designed with an eye to "littoral" combat, or fighting close to China's shores.
Backing this up is China's rapid production of frigates, another small type of warship, and the arming and expansion of the country's coast guard.
This makes sense given the Chinese government's focus on controlling the South China Sea, where it has been building militarized artificial islands and holding regular drills in the sea.
But all this doesn't prevent the Chinese military from having growing its fleet to extend its global influence. The PLA opened its first international base in Djibouti in July 2017. A third aircraft carrier is reportedly under construction, featuring advanced launching capabilities.
"They're building power projection capabilities which will give them greater ability to project presence and power (into) the Pacific and the Indian Ocean," said Malcolm Davis, senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.
Doubts
China has undoubtedly made rapid progress. Some experts, however, doubt its ability to fight as a coherent force or the experience of its troops.
There are also doubts around the effectiveness of some of the PLA's new technologies. Military analyst Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain, has cast doubt on some of the advances allegedly made by the Chinese military, including claims that it has developed a ship-killer ballistic missile.
Is China's latest weaponry science fiction or battle ready?
Such a missile could in theory be based well out-of-range of US naval strike forces while putting Washington's biggest assets, its aircraft carriers, in range.
But Schuster says no military has ever successfully developed an anti-ship ballistic missile and China had shown no evidence of actually being able to hit a moving target in the ocean.
There is also discontent within the Chinese military over the treatment of veterans. The decision in 2015 to lay off 300,000 soldiers over three years to streamline the armed forces led to repeated mass protests in a number of cities after the government failed to pay all their pensions in full.
But Davis said the military prospects of the United States are looking increasingly troubled, thanks to rising maintenance costs and an aging fleet, which might give Beijing the chance it needs to catch up.
"It's not clear the traditional advantage in military technology for the US is going to remain intact," he said.
"Getting that balance between sustainment and modernization right is a real challenge for the US as their forces get older and older, whereas the Chinese are steamrolling ahead." Tsai Ing-wen: The unconventional president staring down Beijing Caught between an aggressive Beijing on one side and an unofficial ally in Washington on the other, Tsai has to maintain a delicate balance.
Her reticence to ingratiate herself to the public has allowed detractors to paint her as a detached politician, someone who doesn't understand the average Taiwan citizen.
Tsai says any perceived aloofness is due to her keen focus on government affairs and international relations. But it's a situation she acknowledges.
"When I became the president, I seemed to be someone rather isolated and [the public] felt that there is a distance of some sort between me and them," she said.

Tsai discusses relationship with US 08:00
Eating noodles in Taipei
It doesn't help that her aggressive progressive agenda, including a focus on LGBT rights and pension reform, have not been big hits with the general public.
Ahead of a 2020 re-election bid, she knows she needs to rehabilitate that image. Some polls have Tsai down as much as 30% against potential Kuomintang presidential nominee Eric Chu, who she defeated in 2016.
Facing an aggressive Beijing, Taiwan's president issues a warning to the world
It's likely a key reason why CNN was given extraordinary access to the President for three days in February.
The takeaway was a leader with a dry wit and self-deprecating humor. At lunch in a Taipei hole-in-the wall, she said noodles were a bad choice.
"I just told the public to eat more rice, because it's healthy and helps support local industry," she said, shaking her head.
Asked whether she came to such places often, she said no, gesturing to the stone-faced security team watching her every move. "They kill my appetite," she said.
Across the street, while buying Chinese-style braised meet, Tsai said it should be washed down with Taiwan beer.
Tsai said one of her biggest regrets from her first two years in office was she didn't spent enough time with Taiwan voters, so they could get to know her. "Many people thought I was a bit detached from them," she said.

Taiwan's president shares the best, worst parts of job 07:55
Shrewd tactician
Tsai may not be a natural politician, but she didn't become Taiwan's first female president by accident.
A shrewd tactician, she spent 15 years as a trade negotiator before leading Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, which handles issues with mainland China. Eventually, she became the head of the Democratic Progressive Party.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen will run for re-election in 2020
A failed bid for the presidency in 2012 did not dissuade her, and she rode to power on a wave of anti-China sentiment in 2016.
Although Taiwan has been self-governed since 1949, Beijing still views the island as a rebel province and is increasing pressure to reunite.
"If it's Taiwan today ... who's next? Any country in the region -- if it no longer wants to submit to the will of China, they would face similar military threats," Tsai said.
Given the relative unpopularity of her domestic policies, she's hoping her hard China stance can be an election-winning issue.
Tsai has certainly been more explicit in her anti-Beijing sentiment of late. In January, she declared China needed to respect Taiwan's independence and she would protect "the free and democratic life of our 23 million people."
"If a vibrant democracy that champions universal values and follows international rules were destroyed by China, it would be a huge setback for global democracy," she told CNN. IRS analyst charged in leak of Michael Cohen's bank records In May 2018, Fry, who works in the IRS' San Francisco office, accessed and downloaded five suspicious activity reports connected to Cohen, according to the complaint. Those reports contained information about a bank account opened for Essential Consultants LLC, a shell company Cohen created, and detailed "numerous suspicious payments" from a company linked to a Russian oligarch, pharmaceutical giant Novartis, AT&T -- which owns CNN -- and others.
Another report contained information that matches the $130,000 that Cohen paid to Avenatti's client, adult-film actress Stormy Daniels, to silence her allegations of an affair with Trump. (Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels.)
Yet another "discussed possible fraudulent and illegal financial transactions" by Cohen in 2016 and 2017 in Singapore, Hungary, Malaysia, Canada, Taiwan, Kenya and Israel, according to the complaint.
About 20 minutes after Fry began accessing the reports, he placed two calls to a number associated with Avenatti, the complaint says, and shortly thereafter, Fry attempted to access two other Cohen-connected suspicious activity reports that the system told him were "unavailable."
According to the complaint, several days later Fry again called Avenatti, and Avenatti subsequently "used his public Twitter account to circulate a dossier releasing confidential banking information related to Cohen and his company Essential Consultants."
Fry also called a reporter at The New Yorker, who isn't named in the complaint but, based on the description of the reporter's work, appears to be Ronan Farrow. After weeks of WhatsApp messages between Fry and the reporter, Farrow published a story that quoted a "law enforcement officer" responsible for the leak of Cohen's banking information as saying he did so because he became alarmed that he was unable to find two of the reports on Cohen.
In fact, the complaint says, the suspicious activity reports that were not available to Fry had been given "restricted access" in the system "because they were related to a sensitive open investigation." At the time, Cohen was being investigated by the Manhattan US attorney's office, which later charged him with eight counts, to which he pleaded guilty.
In recent weeks, Fry's hearing date was pushed back several times as federal prosecutors were engaged with Fry's attorney on plea negotiations, according to a person familiar with the talks. As of Thursday, Fry declined to plead to felony charges in exchange for probation.
As a result, prosecutors will seek an indictment of Fry on February 28, this person said, and are expected to seek two additional charges, misuse of a Social Security number and misuse of a government computer.
Fry is scheduled for a preliminary hearing or arraignment on March 13, according to the US attorney's office. The UK would be 'irresponsible' to let Huawei into 5G, think tank warns Zeng Rong, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, said in a statement that "discrediting a company without any concrete evidence misleads the public, violates rules of commerce and damages business confidence."
"The right approach is to be rational towards foreign companies and support fair competition," she added.
The report's release comes days after the Financial Times reported that the UK's National Cyber Security Centre had concluded the risks of using Huawei equipment in 5G networks could be managed.
The UK government, a key US ally on intelligence and security, is expected to decide this spring which suppliers can provide technology for 5G networks. If it chooses to allow the use of Huawei gear, it could seriously undermine the US campaign against the company and influence other governments that are weighing how to handle the issue.
The UK Department of Culture, Media and Sport said in a statement earlier this week that it was "looking at a range of options" and that "no decisions have been taken."
'A rigorous, ruthless advancement of China's interests'
The RUSI report — written by former diplomat Charles Parton, who spent 22 years working in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan — warned that the UK government needed to stay alert for interference from the Chinese government across a range of fronts, including politics and research.
Britain is a particularly appealing target for interference as a close US ally with a large Chinese ethnic community and an open, advanced economy, Parton said.
Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei: The US 'cannot crush us'
"Beijing's interference is not aimed at subverting the West, but represents a rigorous, ruthless advancement of China's interests and values at the expense of those of the West," he wrote.
Australia and New Zealand have already blocked mobile carriers from using equipment from Huawei, the world's biggest maker of telecommunications equipment, over security concerns.
The United States has made it clear that any country that uses Huawei will find its opportunities to work with Washington limited. In a speech in Munich on Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence described the company as a "threat."
"Chinese law requires them to provide Beijing's vast security apparatus with access to any data that touches their networks or equipment," Pence said.
The RUSI report reached a similar conclusion, saying that although Huawei may be a private company, China's national security laws required cooperation with authorities when requested.
"Huawei's Chinese staff have no choice but to accede to requests from Chinese government departments," the report said.
The Chinese government has denied it would demand access to Huawei's technology for spying, and the company has said it would refuse such a request.
Intelligence ties at risk
If the UK government approves the use of Huawei technology in 5G networks, close allies might be less inclined to work with it in the future, the RUSI report warned.
America's fight with Huawei is messing with the world's 5G plans
Britain is part of the intelligence-sharing group known as Five Eyes, which also includes the United States, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.
"The maintenance of a 'Five Eyes standard' of cyber security in telecommunications is a vital strategic and security interest, the loss of which would go far beyond a reduction in intelligence reports exchanged and might lead to the UK being excluded from work on developing future technologies for intelligence collection," the report said.
It also advised devoting more resources to protecting British universities, where technology of interest to Beijing may be under development.
"Ultimately, the United Kingdom's goal must be genuine reciprocity and an equal, mature and comprehensive relationship with China," the report said. Facing an aggressive Beijing, Taiwan's president issues a warning to the world Unification is a long-term aim for China's ruling Communist Party, which considers self-governed democratic Taiwan -- an island of 23 million people -- to be a renegade province.
But it was the election of Tsai and her historically pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in 2016 which sent relations between the two governments spiraling.

Beijing has placed mounting diplomatic and economic pressure on Taiwan, conducting live-fire drills in nearby seas and flew H-6K bombers and surveillance aircraft around the island.
"With China becoming increasingly strong and ambitious, we are faced with growing threats," Tsai said.
"Our challenge is whether our independent existence, security, prosperity and democracy can be maintained. This is the biggest issue for Taiwan."
Taiwan's unofficial ally the United States has for decades acted as the island's security guarantee against the threat of Chinese military action. But when asked directly, Tsai wouldn't be drawn on whether she believed US President Donald Trump would come to her aid.
Instead the Taiwan leader said she is focused on strengthening Taiwan's own defense capabilities in the face of an "imbalanced war," as China's military modernizes.
"We have to be prepared at all times," she said.
CNN has reached out to the China's Taiwan Affairs Office for comment.

'Growing threats'
As the first woman to be elected Taiwan's leader, Tsai was carried into office on a swell of anti-Beijing sentiment following attempts by the Kuomintang party to move closer to China.
But her popularity has fallen steadily in the face of domestic opposition to her policies and a struggling Taiwan economy battling to keep up with the mainland.
In November Tsai's DPP suffered a bruising defeat in local elections, losing by as much as 10% across the island. Tsai said the 2018 result was due to what she called a "challenging" domestic reform agenda.
"The people don't feel the result of the reform so much when you've just started," she said.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen will run for re-election in 2020
The setback has not deterred Tsai who revealed to CNN she would stand for re-election in 2020. "It's natural that any sitting president wants to do more for the country."
China's Xi is unlikely to welcome a second term for Tsai. Since she came to power, the Chinese government has increasingly tried to exert pressure on Taiwan, known officially as the Republic of China, to unify with the People's Republic of China, as the mainland is officially known.
In January, Xi Jinping called for the "peaceful reunification" of China and Taiwan in a landmark speech, warning that Taiwan independence was a "dead end."
"We make no promise to renounce the use of force," the Chinese leader said.
Tsai said President Xi's January speech had caused concern within Taiwan. She said the island refused to become another Hong Kong or Macau -- both semi-autonomous cities under Beijing's rule.
"(The speech) has alarmed us that Taiwan's independent existence may be changed," she said.
But Tsai said the threats and intimidation out of Beijing are counter-productive to Xi's goals, and serve only to push the island further away from the Communist Party and strengthen support for democracy.
"China may feel such (pressure) would create a sense of failure for people in Taiwan and deal a blow on our morale. But every such move has only further upset and alienated Taiwanese people," she said.
"China's behavior has only backfired in Taiwan."

Warmer ties with Trump
In January Taiwan held military drills intended to ready its troops in the event of an invasion from the mainland. Photos showed dramatic images of helicopters and artillery launchers conducting live-fire exercises.
Tsai said she was strengthening Taiwan's military capabilities in the face of China's rapid modernization. She said Taiwan was "on alert 24/7" for the first sign of a Chinese strike.
"What we are expecting is, after withstanding the first wave of Chinese attacks ourselves, the rest of the world would stand up to exert strong pressure on China," she said.
Taiwan holds military drills to halt invasion amid rising China tensions
While Tsai did not say it specifically, it's likely any pressure exerted on China will come from Washington. For years, the United States has provided a tacit guarantee of protection from Beijing.
Under Trump, the relationship between Washington and Taipei has grown closer with expanded weapons sales and greater vocal support from US politicians.
In 2018 Trump signed into law the Taiwan Travel Act, encouraging "visits between officials of the United States and Taiwan at all levels." Months later, the US approved the sale of submarine parts to Taiwan.
In June, the US opened a new, $255 million de facto embassy on the island, known as the American Institute in Taiwan.
Many leaders around the world have criticized President Trump for focusing on domestic US interests at the expense of the international community but Tsai said she didn't see it that way.
"Any president has to take multiple factors into consideration when making decisions, especially domestic decisions. That's why President Trump has been emphasizing 'America First'," she said.
Trump broke decades of protocol and took a brief congratulatory call from Tsai upon his election in 2016, but the two have yet to meet in person.
There is an outside chance that could change this year. A group of US lawmakers, led by Republican senator Cory Gardner, have asked US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to invite Tsai to address a joint meeting of the US Congress.
But Tsai declined to say whether she would accept an invitation to speak, a move that should it go ahead would be sure to infuriate China.
"It's not a simple question of invitation and acceptance," said Tsai. "Whether or not to go deliver a speech in Washington would depend on whether such a move benefits Taiwan, our relations with the US and regional stability."
The US has been careful, at least publicly, to adhere to a so-called "one China" policy, acknowledging Beijing's assertion that Taiwan is part of China, as well as the People's Republic's status as the sole legitimate government of China. It is this policy that sees the US base its embassy in Beijing, but not in Taipei.
But Washington has also maintained deliberate ambiguity on the status of Taiwan, only encouraging both sides to engage in dialogue to settle their long-running disputes.

Caught in the middle
Trump's foreign policy hasn't all been good news for Taiwan. As the US President tries to drive down the trade deficit, Taiwan has become caught in the middle of a US-China trade war.
"There's a lot of trade and economic flow between Taiwan and the US as well as investment and trade with China," said Tsai. "We have to make sure that we can lessen the impact of any kind of uncertainty on Taiwan's economy."
Tsai said with no clear end to the trade dispute in sight, she was taking actions to protect Taiwan, including government spending to stimulate domestic consumption and investment.
"So that the growth of our economy can be driven by domestic demand instead of an over reliance on exports," said Tsai.
But while the trade war may cause difficulties for Taiwan's exports, it could present an opportunity for the island's tech sector.
The US is currently ramping up its opposition to Chinese technology, in particular the telecoms giant Huawei, over concerns of potential security threats.
Both US Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have warned countries that using Chinese 5G mobile phone technology will make it more difficult to work with the US.
Tsai said that unlike Chinese products, other countries had no such security concerns about Taiwan's technology. "Taiwan is a very secure location for the manufacture of such products," she said.
"We manufacture and design a lot of high-tech products such as semiconductors and we rank in the front in terms of worldwide production."
Taiwan faces down China
Throughout her interview, Tsai painted the picture of Taiwan as an underdog facing down the growing might of Beijing, the first line of defense for the liberal, democratic world order.
"If a vibrant democracy that champions universal values and follows international rules were destroyed by China, it would be a huge setback for global democracy," she said.
Set against that backdrop, military tensions between Taiwan, China and the US have continued to rise.
China and Taiwan clash in Lunar New Year military propaganda videos
On January 2019, Washington sent two guided missile destroyers, the USS McCampbell and USNS Walter S. Diehl, through the Taiwan Strait in a message of defiance to Beijing.
In February, China's People's Liberation Army issued a propaganda video juxtaposing images of Chinese jets and bombers with famous landmarks across Taiwan.
In reply, the Taiwan military posted dramatic footage of soldiers, tanks and explosions, followed by a simple message -- "On standby 24/7."
Tsai said China wants to become a "global hegemony" and if Xi's attention turns to expansion outside of the country's borders, Taiwan would be "first to be hit."
"I believe this is not just an issue of Taiwan under attack, but a reflection of China's willingness to use force for its expansionist policy," she said.

"This is something I have prepared for," said Tsai. "It's again another challenge. Being president, you're not short of challenges. At good times you have challenges of one sort, and in bad times you have challenges of another sort."

Strained relations with Beijing
Despite being self-governed since the end of China's civil war in 1949, Beijing still views Taiwan as a renegade province and part of the People's Republic of China.
Tsai's predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou, forged close ties with Beijing and even met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in a historic 2015 meeting in Singapore.
But relations turned frosty following the election of Tsai, whose party has historically advocated for self-determination.
Taiwan holds military drills to halt invasion amid rising China tensions
The Chinese government, under Xi, has turned up the pressure on Tsai and her administration both economically and politically.
Since 2016, the Chinese military has regularly conducted large-scale military exercises around the island, including sailing the Liaoning aircraft carrier through the Taiwan Strait.
The Taiwan military has responded with anti-invasion drills, including a massive show of force on Taiwan's west coast on January 17.
In a January speech, Xi made a renewed call for Taiwan to rejoin mainland China, telling it to embrace "peaceful reunification" and warning independence was a "dead end."
But in her own New Year's address, Tsai told Beijing to "face the reality of the existence of the Republic of China," the official name for Taiwan.
"Respect the commitment of the 23 million people of Taiwan to freedom and democracy," she said.
Domestic issues
Despite the strained ties, Tsai said cross-strait relations weren't a key factor in her party's setback at last year's elections.
Tsai said she blamed her party's bruising defeat on what she calls a difficult reform agenda she has pushed since taking office.
Her efforts to promote pension reform and push for equal rights for the island's LGBT community have become divisive issues in Taiwan, fueling protests across the island.
In Taiwan, the DPP's loss is China's gain and a setback for the US
"You get attacks, you get criticism, the people don't feel the result of the reform so much when you've just started," Tsai said.
Tsai will face a difficult re-election bid and could be forced to fend off challengers both in her own party and the Kuomintang (KMT), the main opposition party that traditionally favors closer relations with mainland China.
Some polls have Tsai down as much as 30% against potential Kuomintang presidential nominee Eric Chu, who she defeated in 2016.
Asked if there was anything she regretted from her first term in office, Tsai said she felt she had spent too little time talking with voters in her first two years in power.
"I spent too much time in managing the government affairs and I spent a lot of time making foreign visits to our diplomatic allies," she said. "Many people thought I was a bit detached from them."

Despite frequent verbal attacks and obstacles raised by the Duterte administration, Rappler is admired for its fearless reporting on the country's deadly war on drugs and scores of other issues with the current government, including its treatment of opposition politicians.
In the light of its uncompromising record, Ressa's arrest has been widely seen by human rights and journalist activist groups as a warning shot to the press.
"Rappler is a giant here, their body of work is really something," says Carlos Conde, a Human Rights Watch researcher based in Manila.
"Trying to undermine or to sideline Maria Ressa or Rappler is a huge assault on the press in the Philippines," Conde says.

Rappler CEO's arrest "politically motivated", says lawyer 03:02
A message to other journalists
Ressa's arrest "sends an absolutely unequivocal message to anyone working in the Philippines," says Peter Greste, a former Al Jazeera journalist who was jailed in Egypt after producing work critical of the government. He is now an academic in his native Australia and founding director of the Alliance for Journalists' Freedom.
"You can't look at this in isolation, think of it in terms of what it means to the entire media in the Philippines -- if you question the administration, you can expect harassment, intimidation, and arrest."
Why Maria Ressa's arrest should unnerve everyone
Conde agrees, and says the message is stark. "The message is: 'Don't mess with us. We're determined to make our vision for this country a reality.'"
Complicating matters is the culture of violence that Filipino journalists, even before Duterte's rise, have had to face. "The Philippines is still one of the countries with the highest rates of journalist murders," Conde says. "You can publish what you want, you just have to contend with the consequences. You die, you get intimidated or you become Maria Ressa."
Press freedom around Asia
The incident has reverberated through a region that is widely seen as becoming more and more illiberal, from China and North Korea, two of the world's least free countries for the media, to Thailand and Malaysia, which have cracked down harder on the press in recent years.
"It seems to be happening almost everywhere at the same time; it creates new norms and it is very worrying," says Florence de Changy, president of Hong Kong's Foreign Correspondents' Club and an Asia correspondent for French newspaper Le Monde.

","description": "Detained Reuters journalist Wa Lone speaks to journalists after appearing before a court trial in Yangon in August 2018. ","url": "//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180827105320-wa-lone-reuters-myanmar-large-169.jpg",}
She says that the region's "rising intolerance for dissenting views" represents a misunderstanding of the press's role in society.
The 2018 World Press Freedom Index, created by advocacy group Reporters without Borders (RSF), includes Australia, New Zealand and South Korea in its ranking of the top 50 nations for press freedom. The index also lists Taiwan in the top 50. The rest of the Asia-Pacific region falls below that, due to varying levels of harassment, physical abuse, censorship and surveillance of journalists.

The countries that jail journalists the most 03:14
Cédric Alviani, RSF's East Asia Bureau Chief, blames China for setting a bad example. The Asian giant ranks 176th of 180 in the index. "In the past six years, the situation (in China) has worsened a lot. This comes from the bad example that the Chinese authorities are spreading in Asia."
"Other countries in Asia are copying this example. Thailand, the Philippines, it's very worrying," he says, citing the jailing of two Reuters journalists in Myanmar, and a government crackdown on bloggers in Vietnam. The Philippines currently ranks in 133rd place—a fall from 127th place in 2017.
"In Asia more and more you have the idea that media that are critical of the government are anti-patriotic, that they're against the people. This goes against everything we know about democracies, I would say that this is a situation that is very worrying."

How 2 Reuters journalists were jailed 04:55
Chipping away at the media's reputation
Rappler's struggles have a knock-on effect, activists say. "If the capacity to hold governments to account (diminishes), everyone suffers," says Greste. "This is about the public's right to know what their governments are doing in their name. The free press is the best way people have of informing what governments are doing. Otherwise all you get is propaganda."
What is Rappler, the website targeted by the Philippine government?
Shawn Crispin, Senior Southeast Asia Representative at the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), worries that governments elsewhere could see the international community's pallid response to Duterte's attacks on Rappler as license to launch their own crackdowns on critical voices.
"Rappler is widely seen as the epitome of a free press, a news organization that was digging in to what is seen as an abusive government," he says. "When the government fights back, how is the world going to respond?"
"If the wider world's response turns out to be limp, maybe other regions will think they (too) can crack down on journalists. When a government goes after a news organization and gets away with it, it sends a signal across the board," he adds.
Ressa speaks onstage at the Committee To Protect Journalists' International Press Freedom Awards in November 2018.
{"@context": "http://schema.org","@type": "ImageObject","name": "Ressa speaks onstage at the Committee To Protect Journalists&#39; International Press Freedom Awards in November 2018.","description": "Ressa speaks onstage at the Committee To Protect Journalists&#39; International Press Freedom Awards in November 2018.","url": "//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190215164016-maria-ress-press-freedom-4-large-169.jpg",}
Journalists in the Philippines and throughout the region must continue to play their role to the best of their ability, says de Changy, the Hong Kong FCC president.
In an echo of Ressa's famous exhortation to "hold the line" in a speech at the Committee to Protect Journalists awards last year, de Changy says: "Some say we have no choice but to adjust to the red line, but I think we should resist."
Trump's influence
US President Donald Trump's invective against the press is never far from the minds of press freedom advocates in Asia.
"The fact that Trump calls journalists and unfavorable reports 'fake news' is a blessing for every dictator on earth, you can see that in many countries where strongmen use the same argument," says RSF's Alviani.
Asia's strongmen follow Trump's lead on fake news
"When you see people like [Trump] throw out those principles in his public statements, describing press as the 'enemy of the people,' it absolutely gives license to everyone else," says Greste. "His rhetoric has a very significant impact."
Indeed, while parroting terms like "fake news," authoritarians in the region also appear to have copied Trump's actions. Much like CNN White House reporter Jim Acosta's brief White House ban, Ressa and her colleague Pia Ranada have had their access to the Presidential Palace rescinded, severely hampering their reporting abilities.

In December, Philippine presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo, in a response to a question about Ranada's ban, said at a press briefing that access to the presidential palace was a "privilege," according to CNN affiliate CNN Philippines. The strange political path of Nayib Bukele, El Salvador's new President Bukele, who often appears in a glossy leather motorcycle jacket and slicked-back hair, is a Yamaha motorcycle distributor and a declared supporter of Salvadoran soccer team Alianza. His wife, psychologist and ballerina Gabriela Rodríguez, accompanies him on most political activities. In January, Bukele announced that that the pair would soon be parents, tweeting a photo of an ultrasound.
He has stood out from traditional presidential candidates for his reticence with the media. "Bukele favors technology and speaking directly to the people rather than through traditional media," added Allison.
He has also been a fierce critic of past presidents, with campaign slogans such as "There's enough money when nobody steals" and "Return what was stolen," referring to the alleged disappearance of funds during the administrations of former Presidents Francisco Flores and Antonio Saca.
Flores died in January 2016, when he was waiting for a trial date for diversion of funds donated by Taiwan. In September 2018, Saca was sentenced to 10 years in prison for embezzlement and money and asset laundering.
Bukele's strange path to the presidency
Bukele began his political career in 2012 as the FMLN-backed mayor of the small town of Nuevo Cuscatlán. In 2015, he won the mayoral elections of San Salvador, defeating a conservative candidate whose party, the Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA), had ruled for two terms.
After Bukele became mayor, the political relationship between him and his party began to deteriorate. Some analysts say the FMLN considered Bukele too harsh a critic of the then-government of Salvador Sánchez Cerén.
In September 2017, municipal comptroller Xóchitl Marchelli accused Bukele of "throwing an apple" and calling her a "witch" during a meeting of the San Salvador City Council, which Bukele denied. The next month, the FMLN expelled Bukele, citing Marchelli's allegations and accusing Bukele of promoting divisions within the party.
Bukele addresses a crowd.

Bukele took to Facebook Live to announce that he would start a new political party called "New Ideas," but it turned out to be a short-lived venture. Struggling to accredit the nascent party with the Supreme Electoral Tribunal while presidential elections loomed, Bukele abandoned New Ideas and joined an existing party called Democratic Change.
Then in July 2018, Democratic Change was shut down along with three other parties for failing to acquire a minimum number of votes in the 2015 election. Bukele was forced to find a yet another political party to back his candidacy.
Just six months before the elections, Bukele finally found GANA, a party that could last all the way to the presidency. And indeed it did.
An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the name of political science professor Mike Allison. This has been corrected. China and Taiwan clash in Lunar New Year military propaganda videos Tensions between Beijing and Taipei have been steadily increasing since 2016. The Chinese government has been placing greater military and economic pressure on Taiwan, which Beijing regards as part of its sovereign territory despite over 70 years of separation.
In January, Chinese President Xi Jinping warned Taiwan that independence was "a dead end" and called for "peaceful reunification."
Beijing's video and the rapid response from Taipei are particularly unusual given the current Lunar New Year holiday on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, during which governments are largely closed as people take time off to celebrate with family and friends.
Taiwan holds military drills to halt invasion amid rising China tensions
Since the beginning of January, articles in Chinese state-run media outlets have repeatedly highlighted military recruiting efforts and the expanding global role of the PLA.
On January 25, at a meeting of the country's powerful Politburo decision-making body, Xi stressed that the Communist Party needed to strengthen communication across a range of fronts.
"The work of news and public opinion is facing new challenges as profound changes have taken place in the ecology of public opinion, the media landscape and the means of communication," state-run Xinhua quoted Xi as saying.
Military analyst Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain, said China had been ramping up its military propaganda targeted at Taiwan's citizens, as well as a wider domestic and international audience.
"It is trying to convince them they cannot match China's military power, that defeat is inevitable and no one, not even the United States, will come to their aid," Schuster said.

Then-Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin was the designated survivor during the President's 2017 address to a joint session of Congress. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Purdue filled the role during Trump's 2018 State of the Union speech.
Perry is 14th in the presidential line of succession.
The presidential line of succession is outlined in the Presidential Succession Act of 1792, which was updated during the Truman administration in the Presidential Succession Act of 1947. Even though three of the Cabinet positions are currently acting secretaries, they are eligible for the line of succession because they have been Senate-confirmed for other positions, according to 2003 congressional testimony from John Fortier, executive director of the continuity of government commission.
The current line of succession is:
1. Vice President Mike Pence
2. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi
3. Senate president pro tempore Chuck Grassley
4. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
5. Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin
6. Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan
7. Acting Attorney General Attorney General Matthew Whitaker
8. Acting Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt
9. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue
10. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross
11. Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta
12. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar
13. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson
Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao*
14. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry
15. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos
16. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie
17. Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen
*Transportation Sec. Elaine Chao was born in Taiwan and naturalized as a US citizen at 19 years old. She is ineligible to serve as President and therefore cannot be the designated survivor. What's moving markets today What we covered here today

Stock finish Friday mixed after strong jobs report
From CNN Business' Paul R. La Monica
Stocks finished Friday mixed following a stellar jobs report.
The Dow rose 64 points, or 0.3%. The index was up by as many as 193 points earlier in the day, but that rally faded by market close.
The S&P 500 was flat, while the Nasdaq fell 0.3%.
The Dow is now on a six-week winning streak. All three indexes finished with gains of at least 1.3% for the week.
Oil giants ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) helped lead the market higher thanks to strong earnings and production gains. Both stocks rose more than 3%.
Papa John's (PZZA) fell 9% following a report that suggested the pizza chain is no longer looking to sell itself.

Trump call convinces Foxconn to build Wisconsin factory
From CNN Business' Chris Isidore
Foxconn says it is returning to its original plan to make flat screen panels at a new plant in Wisconsin following an appeal from President Donald Trump.
The Taiwan-based electronics manufacturer caused a storm this week when it said it was considering dropping plans to build the panels at the facility, even though it said it was still anticipating hiring 13,000 workers.
The company has been promised $4 billion in state and local incentives to develop the Wisconsin facility.

Midday market update: Rally fades despite sturdy economic data
From CNN Business' Matt Egan
A solid rally on Wall Street is losing some momentum Friday afternoon.
At midday trading, the Dow was up 100 points, down from nearly 200 points earlier.
The S&P 500 inched up 0.2%.
And the Nasdaq turned slightly negative, hurt by a 4% slide for Amazon (AMZN)
The early gains were driven by enthusiasm for a series of upbeat economic reports. Most notably, the Labor Department said the United States added 304,000 jobs in January. It was the strongest jobs report relative to expectations since June 2009, according to Bespoke Investment Group.
The energy sector is in full rally mode, boosted by a 2.3% leap for US oil prices to $55 a barrel.
ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) rose sharply after their big earnings beats. Exxon snapped a string of production declines, while Chevron rolled out a $25 billion buyback plan.

Papa John's slides after reports say it's giving up on finding a buyer
From CNN Business' Jordan Valinsky
Shares of Papa John's (PZZA) sank 7% after Reuters reported that the pizza chain has given up on trying to find a buyer. Instead, it's looking to sell a stake of itself.
The report says the acquisition offers Papa John's received "did not meet its valuation expectations."
Papa John's founder John Schnatter was forced to resign as the company's chairman last July after he used a racial slur on a conference call. He remains on the board and still owns 30% of the company's shares.
Papa John's has struggled since the incident. It has lost roughly one-third of its value over the past year and sales are down.
The company didn't immediately reply to CNN Business' request for comment.

People still love buying UGG boots
From CNN Business' Jordan Valinsky
No ugh for UGG: Decker Brands (DECK), the maker of Tom Brady's favorite cozy clogs, surged 9% at the open after a strong earnings report.
The company's third-quarter sales, which consists of the final three months of last year, rose nearly 11% to $874 million compared to the same period a year earlier.
And it has UGGs to thank for that. Sales for the brand raked in $761 million for the quarter — an increase of 3.6%. Decker said it saw an "accelerated growth" in UGG's mens shoes.
Decker raised its 2019 guidance which also gave the stock a bounce. The company now expects full-year sales to be roughly $2 billion, slightly above the $1.96 billion it previously expected.

Dow opens up 66 points on strong jobs report
From CNN Business' Jill Disis
US markets were mixed at the open Friday, but the Dow moved higher on the heels of a surprisingly strong jobs report.
The
Dow was up 66 points
, or 0.3%.
The
S&P 500 was about flat
.
The
Nasdaq fell 0.1%
.
The Dow's positive open came after the Labor Department reported solid hiring numbers in January it said were largely unaffected by the shutdown. The US economy added 304,000 jobs — the 100th straight month of job gains.
The unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 4%, a move the government did attribute to the shutdown.
ExxonMobil (XOM), a Dow component, also moved 2% higher after the company posted solid earnings for the most recent quarter that suggested its investments in American shale are paying off.

The S&P 500 is up 19% since Trump was inaugurated
From CNN Business' Annalyn Kurtz
Yesterday was the last trading day of the month, so here at CNN Business we decided to update our presidential stock market tracker.
The S&P 500 is up 19% since President Donald Trump was inaugurated a little more than two years ago.
Trump has repeatedly pointed to the stock market as one of his preferred scorecards of his administration’s policies -- so we made a data visualization to show how the stock market performed under each president since Ronald Reagan.
We'll update this tracker after the last trading day of each month.

share link Foxconn says it will build flat screens in Wisconsin after Trump call She also could not say how the decision affects the mix of work to be done on the site, or how many of the hired workers would be involved in manufacturing. She also could not say how many employees would be tech workers and engineers doing research and development.
Earlier this week, Louis Woo, special assistant to Gou, told Reuters that the company planned to create a "technology hub" in Wisconsin rather than a factory promised by Trump and former Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. The facility would largely consist of research facilities along with some packaging and assembly operations. Woo said three-quarters of Foxconn's eventual jobs will be in research and development and design, not blue-collar manufacturing jobs. He said it would not be a factory.
Foxconn moves forward with construction in Wisconsin
Foxconn said changing global market conditions had made it reconsider plans to build flat screens in Wisconsin. It said that it would do some manufacturing on site, but would only commit to less extensive products, such as high-precision molding and system-integration assembly. It did not deny the statements made by Woo, including his comment that the Wisconsin plant could not compete in making flat screens.
Those comments caused a stir because when Foxconn announced plans to build flat screen panels in Wisconsin, it was heralded by President Trump and his supporters as proof of manufacturing jobs moving back to the United States. Critics said the $4 billion package of tax breaks and incentives Foxconn received -- the richest ever offered to a foreign business to locate a plant -- was an example of corporate welfare.
Trump on Friday hailed the company's decision to resume plans to build flat screens in Wisconsin.
"Great news on Foxconn in Wisconsin after my conversation with Terry Gou!" he tweeted shortly after the announcement.
var id = '//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js'.replace(/\s+/g, '');!!document.getElementById(id) || (function makeEmbedScript(d, id) {var js,fjs;js = d.createElement('script');js.id = id;js.charset = 'utf-8';js.setAttribute('async', '');fjs = d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);js.src = '//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';}(document, id));
Even still, Foxconn has scaled back plans from what was originally announced in late 2017 when it indicated it would build large flat screens, the types used in big screen televisions and other high end product. By groundbreaking last summer, it had shifted to much smaller flat screens, the types used in consumer electronic products like appliances and autos. It is the latter product, the small screens, that are back in its plans as of Friday.
And Foxconn could not say how many of the flat screens it will build in Wisconsin under the latest plans as compared to its original announcement.

Some experts following the facility's development have doubts about whether Foxconn will ever follow through on completing the Wisconsin plant. Steven Deller, an economics professor at the University of Wisconsin, laughed when told of the latest announcement Friday afternoon, pointing to other promised Foxconn plants that were never built.
"I think they're playing games," he said. "They've done the same thing to India, Brazil and Pennsylvania. They have a track record of making promises and not living up to them."
Deller said from the beginning of the negotiations it made zero sense to build a flat screen plant in the United States.
"These kinds of screens have become a commodity," he said. "The only way to be competitive is to drive costs down as much as possible. That means going to Asian markets for cheap labor. The R&D component, that makes sense. If you're looking at expanding your product line, it makes sense to do it in the US."

Christine Lagarde goes big on climate change
From CNN Business' Ivana Kottasova
International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde opened the last panel discussion at this year’s Davos by talking about climate change.
The final panel of the conference typically features central bankers and other economic heavyweights, and the discussion tends to focus on the economic outlook for the coming year.
But Lagarde made it clear that climate change is now at the heart of the debate.
Her panelists agreed.
“If temperatures go up two and half degrees, we’ll lose 15% of the world GDP. Three degrees, we will lose 25%,” said Kristalina Georgieva, the CEO of the World Bank.
The first thing she thinks needs to be done? Eliminate fossil fuels subsidies.
“We have done some, we have shrunk [subsidies] by half, but we still have $300 billion to go … it has to happen faster,” said Georgieva.

Teen activist tells Davos elite they're to blame for the climate crisis
From CNN's Ivana Kottasová and Eliza Mackintosh
While some delegates at the World Economic Forum arrived in private jets, 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg took a 32-hour train.
She's been camping out in Davos, giving up the option to stay at a hotel to sleep in a tent in 0 degrees Fahrenheit weather.
In the process, she's been giving Davos a run for its money.
On Thursday, Thunberg gave an impromptu speech at a lunch with a star-studded guest list that included
Salesforce
CEO Marc Benioff, former
Goldman Sachs
president and Trump administration official Gary Cohn, musicians Bono and Will.i.am, and an array of bankers and investors.
"I told them that they belong to that group of people who are most responsible and that the future of humankind rests in their hands, and they didn't know how to react," Thunberg told CNN.
"It was pretty fun."

Richard Quest: Why this Davos was good
From CNN Business' Richard Quest
I’ll be blunt: This year’s Davos was better because US President Donald Trump (and others) stayed away.
2018 was a historic low for Davos. Trump was here, and some participants treated him the same way teenagers would a pop star. The president was the undisputed center of attention, and his presence caused the conference to grind to a halt. As one minister told me, the oxygen can be "sucked out" of Davos when the event is overshadowed by a prominent leader.
The news that Trump would not be coming this year was greeted with regret by the World Economic Forum (their star guest would not be here), and relief by those hoping to actually get something done. When British Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron and other leaders canceled their visits, many commentators couldn't help but proclaim the conference irrelevant.
Now I’ll let you in on a secret: Davos has been much better because they stayed away (IMHO). Top leaders still made important speeches (China's vice president, Wang Qishan, reassured the world about the Chinese economy and bashed the United States in the process). The panel discussions were interesting and lively.
Throughout the Congress Center I saw people engaged in discussions on the top challenges we face, including climate change. Attendees also grappled with the fourth industrial revolution, which will see the world reshaped by artificial intelligence, robotics and other technological breakthroughs.
For the past five years, Davos has pushed the fourth industrial revolution theme down our throats, to little gain. Now, the revolution is well underway and the effects are being felt in developed and emerging markets. Government ministers, finance bosses, NGOs, media – no one can ignore the change now underway, and here at Davos there was real engagement.
As I head down the mountain, I will reflect – Yes, it is good to see political leaders giving speeches and performing on panels. But it's even better to see decision makers and power brokers actually getting to grips with issues of vital importance.
Next year will be the 50th anniversary of the World Economic Forum and there's little doubt that founder Klaus Schwab will pull every string possible to get the biggest names here. I hope that in quiet reflection, organizers realize that this year was so good precisely because the circus stayed at home.

IEA chief: It's going to be a volatile year for oil
From CNN Business' Julia Horowitz
Last year was a wild one for oil prices. Fatih Birol, executive director of the
International Energy Agency
, thinks 2019 could be even worse.
“Last Davos, we sat here and [said] the name of the game is volatility," he said during a World Economic Forum panel moderated by CNN Business' John Defterios. "The volatility [in] the year in front of us may very [well] be much stronger than last year.”
Birol cited a laundry list of potential factors: the slowing global economy, the efficacy of an agreement between OPEC and Russia to reduce oil output and the growing flexibility of US shale production.
Then there's Venezuela. Read how its political crisis could hit oil prices here.

5 top moments from Davos 2019
From CNN Business' Michelle Toh
China reassures: Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan downplayed fears about his country's economic slowdown, arguing that growth remains "significant." "There will be a lot of uncertainties in 2019," he said. "But something that is certain is that China's growth will continue and will be sustainable."
Soros blasts Beijing: George Soros didn't mince words in a speech on Thursday, calling Chinese President Xi Jinping the "most dangerous enemy" of open societies. "Instead of waging a trade war with practically the whole world, the United States should focus on China," he said. He also called on the United States "to crack down" on Chinese tech companies
Huawei
and
ZTE
.
No love for AOC's tax plan: A tax on the rich proposed by US lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was greeted with skepticism by some at Davos. Check out the awkward moment when Michael Dell was asked about it.
Second vote on Brexit? That was the question posed to a large crowd in Davos on Thursday. Almost every hand shot up in support of a second referendum, apart from Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who abstained.
The king of conservation sits down with Prince WilliamDavid Attenborough was one of the stars of this year’s Davos. In an interview on Monday, the naturalist and the British prince discussed the effects humans have had on the natural world since Attenborough started his career six decades ago.

George Soros in Davos: Chinese tech companies cannot be allowed to dominate
From CNN Business' Charles Riley
George Soros has labeled China's President Xi Jinping the "most dangerous enemy" of open societies and recommended a crackdown on Chinese tech companies.
The billionaire said Thursday in Davos that artificial intelligence and machine learning pose a grave threat when they are controlled by authoritarian states. He singled out the use of such technologies by the Chinese government as a "mortal danger."
In a provocative speech delivered to journalists and executives attending the World Economic Forum, Soros warned that the Chinese government was developing a "social credit" system that would monitor people living there.
Soros urged the United States to aggressively counter the threat.
"Instead of waging a trade war with practically the whole world, the United States should focus on China," said the former hedge fund manager.
Soros also said the United States should apply more pressure to Chinese tech companies
Huawei
and
ZTE
, which have been labeled national security threats by some US officials.
"Instead of letting ZTE and Huawei off lightly, [the United States] needs to crack down on them," Soros said. "If these companies came to dominate the 5G market, they would present an unacceptable security risk for the rest of the world."
Huawei and ZTE make telecommunications equipment and smartphones, and both have been caught up in the trade war between China and the United States. The companies have denied that their products pose a security threat.
Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China's Foreign Ministry, shot back at Soros on Friday, accusing him of twisting the facts.
"We hope to see a certain American individual correct his attitude, broaden his horizons and view China’s development in an objective, reasonable and correct manner," Hua told reporters in Beijing.
Soros warned last year in Davos about the danger posed by major tech companies including Google and Facebook, arguing they were monopolies intent on growing ever-more powerful.

10% of the world lives on $2 a day. It's time for businesses to step up
By Chuck Robbins for CNN Business Perspectives US Navy sails warships through Taiwan Strait The approximately 110-mile-wide strait, which separates the People's Republic of China and Taiwan, is seen as a potential geopolitical flashpoint should Beijing ever seek to take the island of Taiwan by force.
Beijing continues to lay claim to Taiwan, a self-governed, democratic island that China views as a breakaway province. While the strait constitutes international waters, China is thought to be very sensitive about the presence of US military forces there.
The US Defense Intelligence Agency issued a report earlier this month saying that China has undertaken a series of ambitious military reforms and acquired new technology, modernization steps the report said were driven primarily by "Beijing's longstanding interest to eventually compel Taiwan's reunification with the mainland and deter any attempt by Taiwan to declare independence."
"Beijing's anticipation that foreign forces would intervene in a Taiwan scenario led the (People's Liberation Army) to develop a range of systems to deter and deny foreign regional force projection," the report added.
America's top naval officer, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson, met with his Chinese counterparts earlier this month, with Chinese military officers raising the issue of Taiwan, according to a report on the Chinese military's English-language website.
"If someone tries to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese military will do whatever it takes to safeguard national reunification, national sovereignty and territorial integrity," Gen. Li Zuocheng, a member of China's Central Military Commission, reportedly told Richardson.
Following his China visit, his second as chief of naval operations, Richardson said the US Navy would continue to send warships wherever international law allows.
"We see the Taiwan Straits as another (set of) international waters, and so that's why we do the transits through the straits, is again just exercising the right to pass through those waters in accordance with international law," Richardson said last Friday while speaking in Tokyo.
Earlier this month, China's President Xi Jinping called on Taiwan to reject independence and embrace "peaceful reunification" with China in a conciliatory speech that nevertheless took a hard line on the island's political sovereignty and freedoms.
The Chinese leader added that "we make no promise to renounce the use of force. We reserve the option for all the necessary means."
In response to Xi's speech, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen said the island will "never accept" a "one country, two systems" arrangement with China.
Richardson said he had told his Chinese counterparts that US policy toward Taiwan had not changed and the US remains "opposed to any kind of unilateral action from either side of the strait that would change that status quo." Taiwan holds military drills to halt invasion amid rising China tensions Although Taiwan holds exercises regularly, the latest war games sharpened their focus on combat readiness as Chinese President Xi Jinping heightens pressure on the self-ruled and democratic island of 23 million people.
"Reunification is the historical trend and the right path, Taiwan independence is ... a dead end," Xi said in a January speech.
Echoing Xi, a top Chinese general on Tuesday told the visiting US chief of naval operations that "if someone tries to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese military will do whatever it takes to safeguard national reunification, national sovereignty and territorial integrity."
The Chinese government has been regularly holding drills around Taiwan as Chinese President Xi ramps up pressure on the island.

A US government report published the same day said the Chinese government has made a series of ambitious military reforms and acquired new technology over the past few years, to improve its military's ability to fight regional conflicts over places like Taiwan.
Xi Jinping warns Taiwan independence is 'a dead end'
China and Taiwan split in 1949 following the Communist victory on the mainland in a bloody civil war. Despite being governed separately for seven decades, Beijing still considers the island part of its territory and routinely threatens the use of force to take it back.
The US maintains formal diplomatic relations only with Beijing, but Taiwan remains an important American ally in the region. Under President Donald Trump, close unofficial ties between the US and Taiwan have grown even stronger.
In the face of Beijing's disapproval, Washington continues to sell advanced weapons to the island under the Taiwan Relations Act for its self-defense against a much bigger Chinese military.
More recently, the Trump administration angered Beijing by authorizing US manufacturers to sell submarine technology to Taiwan, as well as enacting the Taiwan Travel Act to encourage official visits between the US and the island. US report says rapidly modernizing Chinese military has set sights on Taiwan The US DIA report estimates that Chinese spending on its armed forces "probably exceeded $200 billion" in 2018, "a threefold increase since 2002."

China says hypersonic aircraft test a success 00:30
In a written introduction accompanying the report, the Defense Intelligence Agency's director, Lt. Gen. Robert Ashley, wrote that China has used a variety of means to acquire advanced technology to bolster its military capabilities despite some countries attempting to limit its access to that technology over international concerns about Beijing's human rights policies.
"China shifted funds and efforts to acquiring technology by any means available. Domestic laws forced foreign partners of Chinese-based joint ventures to release their technology in exchange for entry into China's lucrative market, and China has used other means to secure needed technology and expertise," Ashley said.
While the report acknowledges that China spends significantly less on defense than the some $700 billion invested by the US in 2018, it says Beijing enjoys an advantage due to the fact that "China has not had to invest in costly R&D of new technologies to the same degree as the United States."
"Rather, China has routinely adopted the best and most effective platforms found in foreign militaries through direct purchase, retrofits, or theft of intellectual property. By doing so, China has been able to focus on expediting its military modernization at a small fraction of the original cost," it said.
'Most modern weapon systems in the world'
China is "on the verge of fielding some of the most modern weapon systems in the world. In some areas, it already leads the world," Ashley wrote.
A senior defense official said the US was concerned that China's increased capabilities may lead its military commanders to advise its political leaders that they were confident of military success with regard to a campaign against Taiwan.
"The biggest concern is that they are going to get to -- they are getting to a point where the PLA leadership may actually tell Xi Jinping that they are confident in their capabilities," the official said, referring to China's leader.
China's reaction to US Navy operation: We have missiles
The report notes that the vast majority of China's missile arsenal is capable of hitting Taiwan while also pointing out that Beijing has developed new weapons systems like the H-6 bomber armed with CJ-20 cruise missiles, which it says is capable of striking areas farther afield, such as US military installations on Guam.
It says, "China has built or acquired a wide array of advanced platforms," including submarines, major surface combat ships, missile patrol craft, maritime strike aircraft and land-based systems that employ new, sophisticated anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missiles.
"China also has developed the world's first roadmobile, anti-ship ballistic missile, a system specifically designed to attack enemy aircraft carriers," it says.
"China's leaders hope that possessing these military capabilities will deter pro-independence moves by Taiwan or, should deterrence fail, will permit a range of tailored military options against Taiwan and potential third-party military intervention," the report said.
Earlier this month Xi called on Taiwan to reject independence and embrace "peaceful reunification" with China in a conciliatory speech that nevertheless took a hard line on the self-governing island's political sovereignty and freedoms.
Xi Jinping warns Taiwan independence is 'a dead end'
And the Chinese leader added that "we make no promise to renounce the use of force. We reserve the option for all the necessary means."
In response to Xi's speech, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen said the island will "never accept" a "one country, two systems" arrangement with China.
While the report says China has increased its military footprint in the South China Sea and has placed additional military facilities on man-made islands there, the Pentagon assesses that China is seeking to avoid a conflict.
"I think both sides have managed to operate professionally. And we have -- it's not in the Chinese interests for a crisis to spiral in the South China Sea. I think that they are fairly comfortable with the progress they've made in building out this infrastructure down there, and then working on negotiations with the other claimant states over a longer term," the senior defense official said.

Photos show encounter with Chinese warship 03:42
During his China visit, Adm. Richardson said the US Navy would continue to send warships wherever international law allows, something the Pentagon says when undertaking so-called "freedom of navigation" operations near Chinese-claimed territory in the South China Sea.
"The US Navy will continue to conduct routine and lawful operations around the world, in order to protect the rights, freedoms and lawful uses of sea and airspace guaranteed to all," Richardson said in a China-datelined story posted on the US Navy's website.
He also called on China to avoid dangerous maneuvers during those US operations.
"It important for all military, law enforcement, and civilian vessels and aircraft, including those in the PLA Navy, the Chinese Coast Guard, and the People's Armed Forces Maritime Militia, to operate in a safe and professional manner, in accordance with international law," Richardson is quoted as saying. "Consistent operations and behavior are critical to preventing miscalculation."
Last fall, the Chinese destroyer Lanzhou came within 45 yards (41 meters) of the guided-missile destroyer USS Decatur near the Spratly Islands in an encounter the US called "unsafe." Taiwan appoints new Premier amid rising China tensions Last week, Chinese President Xi Jinping called on Taiwan to reject moves towards formal independence and embrace "peaceful reunification" with his country, suggesting the island adopt the concept of "one country, two systems" as used in Hong Kong when China regained sovereignty over the city from the UK in 1997.
While his speech sounded more conciliatory than previously, Xi did not rule out using military force to take Taiwan. In the past he has vowed not to cede "a single inch of our motherland," and increased military drills around the self-ruled and democratic island of 23 million people.
Tsai rejected Xi's "one country, two systems" suggestion outright, and on Friday she emphasized that Taiwan's priorities in 2019 include protecting its democracy and safeguarding its sovereignty, in addition to improving people's livelihoods.
She acknowledged the challenges ahead as Taiwan, whose economy is closely linked to that of China, tackles the fallout of the trade war between Washington and Beijing, as well as renewed fears of Xi's hardline stance.
China and Taiwan -- officially the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China, respectively -- split in 1949 following the Communist victory on the mainland after a bloody civil war.
They have been governed separately ever since although a shared cultural and linguistic heritage largely endures, with Mandarin the official language in both places. Astronaut: What China's moon landing means for US Astronaut: Trump's plan for the space station a huge mistake
While China is preparing its space station, with plans to start sending parts up in 2020, America is planning to exit the International Space Station -- the collaborative effort of 15 nations -- in 2024-2025. According to an internal NASA document obtained by The Washington Post in early 2018, the plan is based on the unrealistic idea that we can transition management of the facility to a commercial entity.
The ISS was never designed to be operated profitably. Mission control centers in Houston and Moscow must be permanently staffed to support it, and launch and landing costs would be prohibitive to any commercial entity.
Meanwhile, China could land astronauts on the moon as early as the 2030s, leapfrogging NASA in their lunar capabilities.
But perhaps the US should have seen this coming. In 1965, at the height of the Apollo program, NASA had 5.3% of the federal budget. Today, even though the budget is a slightly higher than it has been in recent years, it sits at around just 0.4%.

China first in history to land rover on far side of the moon 04:29
With those measly funds, NASA's ambitions are inevitably limited. This doesn't seem likely to change, with the White House seemingly more intent on creating the so-called "Space Force," a new military branch, than investing in a real space exploration program.
To be fair, we are still doing some amazing things in space. Very recently, the New Horizons spacecraft, after making groundbreaking discoveries and images of Pluto, went on to image Ultima Thule -- by far the most distant object ever imaged -- at about 4 billion miles from Earth. The OSIRIS REx spacecraft established orbit around the 500 meter-diameter asteroid Bennu, some 100 million km from Earth. It will bring back a sample of the asteroid for analysis. The Parker Solar Probe is performing ground-breaking measurements of our sun. The Mars InSight spacecraft just landed on Mars to do studies that have never been done before, like seismic studies.

These great missions notwithstanding, our space program could be on the verge of being outdone. It is a classic case of the "Tortoise and the Hare." We have been so used to being on top for so long that our politicians have gotten complacent.
Indeed, the failure to prioritize our space capabilities is nothing new. President Barack Obama proclaimed that America would go to Mars by the 2030s but did not sufficiently prioritize funding the program.
Now we have come to the moment of China's ascendency in space exploration. We must face the reality that it has, in a small but significant way, shown the world that it can be the first to accomplish things in space, too. We had better realize this soon, or we may very well wake up to find that we are no longer top dog in the space business. And if we don't learn from our complacency in space, we could end up losing our edge in other areas as well.
Correction: This piece originally misstated how far Bennu is from Earth. It has been updated to reflect the correct distance. Xi Jinping warns Taiwan independence is 'a dead end' Cross-strait tensions
Xi's speech comes a day after Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen gave her own New Year's address, in which she called on Beijing to "face the reality of the existence of the Republic of China," referring to the island by its official name. She also urged that Beijing to "respect the commitment of the 23 million people of Taiwan to freedom and democracy."
Tsai resigned as head of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in November after the historically pro-independence party suffered a crushing defeat in local government elections, which also saw voters reject a proposal for the island to compete in international sporting events as "Taiwan" rather than "Chinese Taipei," a moniker adopted after pressure from Beijing.
While she acknowledged the elections were a "serious test for the current government," Tsai said the results "absolutely do not mean that grassroots public opinion in Taiwan favors abandoning our sovereignty, nor do they mean that the people want to make concessions regarding Taiwanese identity."
She also pointed to allegations of Chinese influence over those elections, saying Beijing's "attempts to use the openness and freedom of our democratic system to interfere in Taiwan's internal politics and social development (have) now become Taiwan's greatest challenge."
During his speech, Xi said China had "achieved a great victory in frustrating the Taiwan independence movement and other separatist activities."
Lev Nachman, a Taiwan specialist and PhD student in Political Science at the University of California Irvine, said this appeared to be an oblique acknowledgment of interference in the island's politics.
"I am not sure we are going to get a more clear direct admittance from Xi himself that the (Chinese Communist Party) interferes with Taiwan's democratic elections," he said. "This is something we have always known was a phenomenon, but never really had any 'hard proof'."
Nachman said Xi's speech showed Beijing "now more than ever anticipates that Taiwan will naturally head towards a unification path."
"If the CCP is confident it can stop the DPP from maintaining its status as the governing party and can even actively help restore the KMT to power, it has no need to use force," he added, referring to the pro-unification Kuomintang, which governed Taiwan for decades following the Chinese civil war.

Hong Kong model
Throughout his speech -- and those of other Chinese officials introducing him -- Xi pointed to "One Country, Two Systems" as the model for Taiwanese reunification.
That is the principle by which Hong Kong transferred from British to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, maintaining the city's limited democracy, economic system and political freedoms under Chinese rule. For many years, Hong Kong was seen as a model for Taiwan, an advertisement for future reunification, and Xi's speech harkened back to this.
"One Country, Two Systems was raised to accommodate Taiwan's reality and safeguard the interests and benefits of Taiwan compatriots ... under the precondition of ensuring national sovereignty and national security," Xi said.
How attractive a model Hong Kong is to many in Taiwan is debatable, however, as recent years have seen Beijing renege on promises to expand democratic rights, and multiple prominent pro-democracy figures have been jailed, harassed and banned from standing for election. Political and press freedoms have also declined in the city.
"Xi's call to Hong Kong as the One Country, Two Systems experiment I think shows what an ideal 'unification' looks like from Beijing's perspective: put Taiwan in a position that allows some autonomy still, but slowly erode it until it is retaken completely," Nachman said.
"Xi would like Taiwanese people to see themselves as in the same position as Hong Kongers, which they do not."
Speaking in Taipei Wednesday following Xi's speech, Tsai said the island would not accept a Hong Kong-style arrangement, and called on Beijing to respect Taiwan's political sovereignty.

'No promise to renounce force'
While Xi's speech was conciliatory, emphasizing the need for "peaceful reunification" above all else, he did not rule out military force if Taiwan were to pursue de jure as well as its longtime de facto independence.
"We are willing to create broad space for peaceful reunification, but will leave no room for any form of separatist activities," he said.
"We make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means," he said, adding that the "issue of Taiwan is part of China's domestic politics (and) foreign interference is intolerable."
While it does not formally recognize Taiwan, the US maintains strong ties with Taipei, which have been bolstered under US President Donald Trump.
In November, the US Navy sailed two ships through the Taiwan Strait, and Washington recently upgraded its de facto embassy in Taipei, the American Institute in Taiwan, to the tune of $255 million. 5 things to know for January 2: Shutdown, Paul Whelan, North Korea, tiny survivor 2. American detained in Russia
An American arrested last week in Russia is no spy, his family says. Paul Whelan, a 48-year-old corporate security director from Michigan, was detained by the Russians and accused of spying. Whelan, who has been to Russia many times, was there for a wedding, his twin brother told CNN. If convicted of spying, Whelan could get 20 years in prison. His arrest comes just weeks after Russian Maria Butina pleaded guilty to trying to infiltrate GOP political circles and influence US relations with Russia before the 2016 election. A CNN national security analyst thinks the Russians may be planning to trade Whelan for Butina.

3. Houston shooting
A simple weekend coffee run turned into tragedy for a family in Texas. A 7-year-old girl was shot in the head and killed in a drive-by shooting. Jazmine Barnes was in a car with her mother and three sisters when a red pickup truck suddenly pulled up. The man driving it opened fire in what police are calling an unprovoked shooting. "He intentionally killed my child for no reason," Jazmine's mother told reporters through tears as she recovers from her own gunshot wound at a hospital. Police are searching for the man and a motive.

4. North Korea
A new year means New Year's greetings from world leaders. Last year, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un offered South Korea an olive branch in his New Year's address. That kicked off a year of summits and a promise by the North to get rid of its nukes. In this year's address, Kim said that's still the plan (though there's no evidence the North is actually doing it). But he warned the US the North may need to pursue "a new way" to peace on the Korean Peninsula if the Americans keep making "one-sided demands" and threatening more sanctions. Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping gave a New Year's address of his own and used it to caution Taiwan that independence is "a dead end."

5. Apartment explosion
Rescuers searching the rubble of an apartment building that was leveled by a suspected gas explosion found a miracle: a baby boy still alive in the debris. Video from the Russian government showed rescuers saving the child, who was wearing a top and pink socks and covered in dust. At least eight people died in the blast Monday in the city of Magnitogorsk. It's estimated the infant endured 35 hours of freezing temperatures before being found.
