      "Why China is challenging Australia for influence over the Pacific Islands The Pacific Islands are home to fewer than 10 million people -- slightly less than the population of Sweden -- are thousands of miles from Beijing and have a combined GDP of about $33.77 billion, less than 1% of China's total GDP.\n",
      "But that hasn't stopped the money flooding in, building bridges, roads and an airport.\n",
      "In Australia, some analysts fear their country's influence is under threat.\n",
      "\"Australia is certainly very worried about the level of investment (from China),\" said Michael O'Keefe, an expert on Pacific foreign relations at Melbourne's La Trobe University.\n",
      "Prime Minister Morrison has made the Pacific Islands more of a priority than his predecessors since he came to power last year. As he announced a 2 billion Australian dollar ($1.5 billion) infrastructure fund for the region in November, he said: \"Australia cannot take its influence in the Southwest Pacific for granted.\n",
      "\"And sadly, I think too often we have.\"\n",
      "So why is China investing so much in this part of the world?\n",
      "First thing's first: What's China doing in the South Pacific?\n",
      "In many ways, China is doing things differently.\n",
      "In the past, Australia has taken what some see as a paternalistic approach in the Pacific Islands, investing in health, education and governance -- the things it thinks the nations need.\n",
      "But the approach hasn't necessarily had the desired impact. Although Australia -- and other countries -- have been investing aid in the region for years, economic growth is slow. That's partly due to the geographic isolation of the islands and their small populations, but has been worsened by their vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters.\n",
      "In most Pacific Island countries, more than 20% of the population is unable to afford all their basic needs, according to the World Bank.\n",
      "That has prompted questions about the effectiveness of aid.\n",
      "In papers in 2003 and 2010, Australian economist Helen Hughes said that \"aid has failed in the Pacific,\" because it undercut the private sector, impacting employment and economic growth. But Australian economist Matthew Dornan and Jonathan Pryke, director of the Pacific Islands Program at the Lowy Institute, argued in 2017 that aid has raised \"living standards beyond what they would be without aid.\" The Lowy Institute is a non-profit Australian think tank set up in 2003, which receives half of its funding from donations.\n",

      "China, by contrast, is asking Pacific Island countries where they most need investment. That has tended to result in Beijing funding large-scale infrastructure projects.\n",
      "Data from the Lowy Institute on the eight countries where both Australia and China are investing shows that in all but one of the nations, China's biggest spend was on an infrastructure project, while all but one of Australia's top projects were non-infrastructure.\n",
      "In Papua New Guinea, for instance, China completed a $85 million road upgrade in 2017. Meanwhile, Australia has so far spent $219 million on an initiative to deliver essential drugs such as vaccines, and increase health education, especially around the spread of HIV.\n",
      "In 2018, Australia's Minister for International Development and the South Pacific, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, blasted China for funding \"useless buildings\" that islands couldn't pay back, but didn't refer to any projects specifically. China lodged a formal diplomatic protest against the minister, calling her remarks \"full of prejudice and bias.\"\n",

      "There's another difference between the two players: how the money is delivered.\n",
      "While Australia gives its aid through grants with no obligation for repayment, most of China's spending is in the form of loans, according to the Lowy Institute.\n",
      "Many of the Chinese loans were taken between 2006 and 2010, said the Lowy Institute's Jonathan Pryke. This was during a \"gold rush\" period when China was increasingly lending to countries around the world, including in Africa. The loans usually have a grace period of five to 10 years, according to Pryke. So far, there's no record of any Pacific Island countries paying China back, Lowy Institute research found.\n",
      "Earlier this year, the US Ambassador to Australia, Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr., described China's spending in the Pacific as \"payday loan\" diplomacy -- intentionally getting countries to take on unsustainable debts in order to buy political leverage. US Vice President Mike Pence has echoed his sentiment.\n",
      "But the data doesn't back up these claims.\n",
      "Of the 14 Pacific Island nations, six are rated as being at a high risk of debt distress by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), meaning they are likely to default on their loans, and three are at a moderate risk.\n",

In a Lowy Institute poll this year, 55% of those surveyed said if China opened a military base in a Pacific Island country, that would be a critical threat to the nation's vital interests.\n",
      "Australia and the US have military plans of their own. Last year, the US, Australia and Papua New Guinea announced they would partner to redevelop a naval base on PNG's Manus Island, best known for a controversial and now shuttered migrant detention center. During World War II, the island was home to a Japanese base that was captured and taken over by the Allies.\n",

      "Beijing invested over $1.2 billion in the 14 South Pacific nations between 2011 and 2017, but last year alone, it pledged $60 billion in aid, investment and loans to Africa.\n",
      "In contrast, in the same period, Australia spent $6.3 billion in aid in the South Pacific, making the region one of the main beneficiaries of Australian aid.\n",
      "Australia has good reason to make that investment. Since the 1950s, it has been part of an agreement with the US and New Zealand, making it responsible for the security of the Pacific Islands.

      "Ulrike Lemmin-Woolfrey is a freelance writer and author based in Melbourne, Australia. Her first book is \"Living Abroad in Australia\" (2nd edition) by Moon Travel Guides and she's currently working on the \"Moon Handbook to Sydney & the Great Barrier Reef,\" and \"Spotlight Sydney,\" both due to be published in late 2014. China's economic slowdown is real, but it's not just about tariffs But analysts argue that the yearlong trade war is not the biggest drag on the world's second largest economy. The slowdown has as much to do with a debt mountain and cautious consumers.\n",
      "Debt and defaults\n",
      "China has been struggling for years to rein in high levels of debt, arising from a massive stimulus package launched during the 2008 financial crisis.\n",
      "While the stimulus boosted economic growth, it resulted in a $40 trillion mountain of government, corporate and household debt worth more than 300% of China's GDP as of March 2019, according to a report from the Washington-based Institute of International Finance this week.\n",
      "China's overall debt now accounts for about 15% of the global total, the IIF added.\n",
      "The Chinese government has reacted by tightening regulations in the financial system, scaling back bank lending, and clamping down on unregulated lending, also known as shadow banking.\n",
      "But these efforts to reduce China's reliance on debt-fueled growth have also made it more difficult for companies to obtain financing, especially private sector firms that usually find it harder to raise funds from banks than larger but less efficient state-run firms.\n",
      "China's car market fell off a cliff this year. It faces a long road back\n",
      "Last year, defaults by Chinese companies hit a record high. In the first six months of this year, the number of defaults increased more than threefold from the same period last year, according to data compiled by Wind, a Chinese financial data provider.\n",
      "\"Credit is still not flowing to the sectors that need it most,\" said Stephen Innes, managing partner of Singapore-based investment firm Vanguard Markets. Innes estimates that around 50% of the defaults came from China's large manufacturing sector, mostly by private companies.\n",
      "Consumers are cutting back\n",
      "The hit to growth this year has come from Chinese consumers, who hold off spending because they worry about the economy's future and rising personal debt levels. Elevated property prices have also strained their purchasing power.\n",
      "Retail sales grew by 8.4% in the first half, down from 9% in the same period last year. And some of the world's biggest companies are feeling the pinch.\n",
      "Apple's (AAPL) sales in China have tumbled. Its revenue in the Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, dropped 21.5% in the second quarter from the same period a year ago. Greater China accounted for about 18% of Apple's total revenue.\n",
      "Weak car sales are also a big part of the story. Total spending on cars increased by just 1.2% in the first six months of the year.\n",
      "Ford said earlier this month that it sold nearly 22% fewer vehicles in China during the second quarter than in the same period a year ago. General Motors posted a 12% drop in vehicle sales in China for the quarter.\n",
      "Steady deceleration\n",
      "China's economic slowdown predates the trade war by several years.\n",
      "Growth hit a record high of 14.2% in 2007 but has been steadily falling since as China grapples with several pressures on its economy.\n",
      "The government has lowered its growth target to a range of 6% to 6.5% for this year.\n",
      "China's efforts to shift its economy from one focused on manufacturing to one driven by technology and services have also contributed to the slowdown.\n",
      "Beijing has been cutting excess capacity in heavy industries such as steel, cement, shipbuilding, while encouraging domestic firms to shift to higher value-added areas.\n",
      "While that transition has seen the rise of giants like Tencent (TCEHY), Alibaba (BABA) and Huawei, it has also caused growing pains as traditional manufacturing workers struggle to make the shift.\n",
      "Baidu posts its first loss in 15 years as China's slowdown hits online advertising\n",
      "China has recently cut taxes and increased infrastructure spending in a bid to prevent a hard landing for the economy, but analysts say the country's model of state-sponsored growth may no longer work.\n",
      "\"Continued reliance upon infrastructure projects with decreasing marginal returns seems unlikely to revive China's economy, and its state-run capital allocation system is an irrational and inefficient mess,\" said Brock Silvers, managing director for Shanghai-based Kaiyuan Capital.\n",
      "\"Beijing has been working furiously to fix the economy... but its old methods may not fix its new problems,\" he added. Chaos reigns in Washington At one point, the presiding officer, Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Missouri, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, laid down his gavel and walked out in frustration.\n",
      "Here are the 4 Republicans who voted to condemn Trump's racist tweets\n",
      "Republicans twisted themselves in knots to avoid angering constituents by condemning the President's tweets, and sought to rebrand them as a patriotic denunciations of the extreme socialism they say is infecting the Democratic Party.\n",
      "\"I think this party has been very clear, we are the party of Lincoln,\" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said.\n",
      "The Republican strategy was a reminder that most lawmakers in divided, gerrymandered America are more concerned about being primaried by a more radical activist than seeking the disappearing political center ground. It also underscored the omnipresent power of a President who warned colleagues whose history shows no previous sign of being reluctant to condemn racism not to show \"weakness.\"\n",
      "In an incongruous moment, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was stumped when asked what he would do if someone told his Taiwan-born wife to go back to the nationalist island.\n",
      "More from Stephen Collinson\n",
      "Progressive lawmakers stand firm against Trump's repeated racist attacks\n",
      "Trump's most openly racist rhetoric yet is not at all surprising\n",
      "The courts define Trump's presidency in all ways\n",
      "Trump seeking change of legal fortune after long losing streak\n",
      "In the twilight zone of the White House, the man who unleashed the fury, Trump, expressed disgust at the \"vile, horrible statements\" said by the women he targeted over the color of their skin.\n",
      "In a bizarre moment outside, senior Trump aide Kellyanne Conway demanded to know the ethnicity of a reporter who asked her which country the four American lawmakers should return to.\n",
      "In a later Fox News interview, Conway said the women represented \"the dark underbelly\" of disrespect for America's military.\n",
      "And in another surreal twist to the situation, Conway's husband George earlier penned his latest devastating op-ed blasting his wife's boss as a \"racist President\" beyond the bounds of human decency.\n",
      "But white nationalist Richard Spencer complained to CNN that Trump wasn't going far enough, saying he gave the movement nothing \"outside racist tweets\" that seem like the came from \"a drunk uncle.\"\n",
      "The price of division\n",

      "Cooper shines light on Conway's 'dark underbelly' comment 05:23\n",
      "At times, it was hard to believe such scenes -- inciting buried hatreds and toxicity that only racial politics can provoke -- were taking place one-fifth of the way through the 21st Century.\n",
      "Yet this is what the Trump presidency has wrought. There is a price for the constant tearing of some of the nation's deepest divides. Some of it was on display in the rising tensions and distemper in Washington on Tuesday.\n",
      "The lasting impact of such conscious polarization on the part of a President -- an office holder who is normally looked on to heal national wounds -- is not yet clear. But it is likely to be discombobulating and to leave the country more torn and difficult to govern whenever it is that Trump leaves the political scene.\n",
      "Even Anthony Scaramucci, the short-lived former White House communications director and longtime Trump friend, rebuked the President's \"bully-ish, Neanderthal-ish\" racist comments.\n",
      "And Tuesday is only the beginning. Since Trump has put white nationalist fear mongering at the center of his reelection campaign, the atmosphere will surely worsen as 2020 looms.\n",
      "\"This is not going to be the last time this happens. We are going to be having this discussion a lot in the next 17 months because he thinks it is to his advantage to do it,\" David Axelrod, a CNN senior political analyst and former Barack Obama strategist said on \"The Lead with Jake Tapper.\"\n",
      "\"And, yes, it is important for us as a country to express our moral outrage about these tactics, but at some point, they have to be discussed as tactics.\"\n",
      "Under normal circumstances, it would be a legacy-defining moment if a President was rebuked for racist language by the one half of a rival branch of government.\n",
      "That it is not is a measure of how Trump broke the political mold, enjoys impunity for his boundless conduct and has utterly co-opted his party.\n",
      "In the warped political calculations of the Trump era, the developments in the last few days might even come to be seen as some kind of political victory for the President.\n",
      "By singling out Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, he hoped to make some of the most radical Democrats the face of the party ahead of 2020. They have promised not to take Trump's \"bait\" but conservative media is making sure that Trump's base sees plenty of the quartet. It's also painting the President's racism as an example of liberal hysteria and yet more victimization of Trump by critics who are obsessed with identity politics.\n",
      "And the President is not going to lose any sleep about being censured by the House. He's always framed himself as the scourge of the Washington elite and he knows GOP control of the Senate means he won't be embarrassed in the other chamber.\n",
      "And for a day at least, the Democrats were distracted from their plans to pass a positive agenda on issues like health care, education and climate change that preoccupy their voters.\n",
      "Normally, at moments of Trump-induced dysfunction, commentators note that the President engineers chaos as a master stroke to keep his political foes off balance.\n",
      "His instinctive, incessant stoking of his base is interpreted as an effort to emulate his shock 2016 election win. Yet the President's inflammatory rhetoric during the midterm elections seemed to alienate many more moderate voters who he will still need to win a second term.\n",
      "He's playing a risky political game -- though it may be the only one he really knows how to play.\n",
      "Looking for cover\n",

      "The US State Department gave its approval of the multibillion-dollar arms deal with Taiwan on July 8, which includes 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks and Stinger missiles.\n",
      "In response, China's Foreign Ministry said it would impose sanctions on any companies selling arms to Taiwan, although it didn't single any out by name.\n",
      "Speaking on Monday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he wasn't in a position to \"disclose more details\" at present.\n",
      "\"Please believe that China always keeps its promises and its actions always produce results,\" he said.\n",
      "Among the companies that could be affected would be Raytheon Missile Systems, who make the Stingers, or General Dynamics Land Systems, who are responsible for the Abrams tanks.\n",
      "\"In order to safeguard national interests, China will impose sanctions on US companies involved in the arms sales to Taiwan,\" spokesman Geng said Friday.\n",
      "US would be 'stupid' to treat China as an enemy, senior diplomat says\n",
      "La Trobe University associate professor James Leibold said that Taiwan was being used as a bargaining chip by both US and China and the threat of sanctions showed Beijing felt ready to escalate the issue.\n",
      "Taiwan was becoming more of a \"hot-button issue\" for both governments due to a push for closer relations from Washington, said Leibold.\n",
      "\"Clearly some in the Trump administration want to strengthen the alliance with Taiwan, and as we all know the Taiwan issue has always been a deeply sensitive one for the People's Republic of China,\" he said.\n",
      "Taiwan has been self-ruled since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, which saw the Communist Party take control of the mainland and the Nationalist government forced to flee to the island.\n",
      "But Beijing still views the island as their territory and has worked consistently for decades to try to threaten or cajole it into rejoining with the mainland.\n",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has regularly called for the reunification of Taiwan, even refusing to rule out force in a major speech in January.\n",
      "In the past year, China has ramped up its military exercises around the island. It held live fire drills in the Taiwan Strait in 2018, while Chinese fighter jets crossed the maritime border separating the island from the mainland in a rare incursion in April.\n",
      "Taiwan's Ministry of Defense said that the PLA's drills on Sunday were \"nothing more than routine exercises,\" according to Taiwan's news agency CNA, adding that the island's military was ready to respond to any threats.\n",
      "Taiwan president defiant\n",
      "The rise in tensions comes amid a visit to the US by Taiwan President Tsai on her way to visit the island's allies in the Caribbean.\n",
      "Tsai is spending an unusually long stopover of four nights in the country, including two nights in New York. There is no confirmation of what meetings she is expected to have while in the country.\n",
      "Her visit alone was enough to antagonize the Chinese government, which opposes any official contact between Washington and Taipei.\n",
      "Taiwan's Tsai Ing-wen warns against 'overseas forces' at beginning of US trip\n",
      "\"Allowing Tsai to 'stop over' violates the #oneChina principle ... China urges the US to properly handle the Taiwan issue to prevent damaging China US relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,\" China's embassy in the US said on its official Twitter Friday.\n",
      "But Tsai hasn't been deterred by the Chinese government's opposition, holding a public meeting with representatives of Taiwan's remaining 17 allies in New York.\n",
      "\"Taiwan will firmly defend our democratic system. Our democracy has not come easily and is now facing the threat and penetration of overseas forces,\" said Tsai, implicitly criticizing Beijing. On her way back to Taipei, Tsai will stop over in Denver, Colorado.\n",
      "While in the Caribbean, Tsai will visit St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia and Haiti.\n",
      "Taiwan's leader has taken an increasingly strident anti-China stance ahead of the national election in January 2020 where she will seek re-election.\n",
      "It was announced on Monday that she will face opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate Han Kuo-yu, who won his party's nomination with 44% of the vote.\n",
      "Despite being viewed as more pro-Beijing than Tsai, Han appeared to take a harder stance against further integration with the mainland in June, amid increasingly heated protests in Hong Kong.\n",
      "\"'One Country, Two Systems' can never be implemented in Taiwan. Taiwanese people can never accept it, unless it's over my dead body,\" Han told a rally in June. Trump's most openly racist rhetoric yet is not at all surprising But Trump risks opening divides that will take years to heal.\n",
      "By telling the four women — three of whom were born in the US — to \"go back\" to where they came from, Trump employed the most basic and crude racial taunt. He also implicitly rejected the motto emblazoned on America's Great Seal — E Pluribus Unum — from many one. He is implying that any American who is not white and native born has no place in the country.\n",
      "Trump tweets racist attacks at progressive Democratic congresswomen\n",
      "In a less polarized time, Trump's tweets may have been disqualifying and an outrageous political twist. But Trump forged his entry into politics based on a racist slur against the nation's first black President Barack Obama and he has become ever more willing to use such tactics to save his own presidency. And he's rarely paid a price.\n",
      "The silence from Republicans Sunday about Trump's tweets was near universal, emphasizing how his outlandish behavior is tolerated by lawmakers who represent half of the electorate and who won't risk their own political careers to condemn him.\n",
      "With just more than 15 months to go before the next president is chosen, the already poisonous tone of Trump's reelection campaign seems almost certain to become far, far worse. The question is whether Trump will alienate sufficient crops of more moderate voters to swing the White House to Democrats or whether his raging culture wars will maximize turnout in his own party and hand him a second term.\n",
      "His attack is a logical extension of an election strategy that is clearly designed to exploit racial and social divides.\n",
      "Trump's tweets came on a day when border agents started raids targeting undocumented migrants — bolstering Trump's scorched earth immigration rhetoric at the center of his 2020 campaign.\n",
      "AOC responds to Trump's racist attacks: 'You cannot accept that we don't fear you'\n",
      "They took the President's current fear and conspiracy-laden politics to a fresh peak, after he warned last week of \"illegal aliens in our midst\" and maligned the patriotism of his critics at inflammatory White House events.\n",
      "In the face of widespread outrage -- even British Prime Minister Theresa May's office called the tweets \"completely unacceptable\" -- Trump refused to back down, calling Monday morning for the \"radical left congresswomen\" to apologize \"to our Country, the people of Israel and even to the Office of the President, for the foul language they have used, and the terrible things they have said. So many people are angry at them & their horrible & disgusting actions!\"\n",
      "At the White House, Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff Marc Short struggled to come up with a credible defense of the President. He said Trump's choice of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, a naturalized American who was born in Taiwan, proved that he was not racist since she was \"an Asian woman of color.\" He also highlighted Pence's role in presiding over a naturalization ceremony on July 4.\n",
      "Short also claimed that Trump was specifically targeting one of the congresswomen, Somali-born Rep. Ilhan Omar -- who has been criticized for anti-Semitic remarks -- even though the President's tweets indicate otherwise.\n",

      "Will Republicans condemn Trump's racist attacks? 01:29\n",
      "Trump targeted the liberal Democratic lawmakers in a flurry of Sunday morning tweets that reverberated with extremist white nationalistic sentiment.\n",
      "He hit out at congresswomen who he claimed \"originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world ... now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run.\"\n",
      "\"Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done.\"\n",
      "A House Democratic feud was nearing a crisis point. Then Trump got involved.\n",
      "Trump was referring to four lawmakers who have been in conflict with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Omar from Minnesota, Michigan's Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley from Massachusetts. All of the women have been outspoken about Trump's immigration policies.\n",
      "Of that quartet, only Omar — who is originally from Somalia — was not born in the United States, but she immigrated to the United States when she was young and became a citizen at the age of 17, according to The New York Times.\n",
      "The reason why Trump's attack was not surprising is because it fits into a pattern of racially charged rhetoric that he has been willing to use in private life — dating back to his comments on the Central Park Five and the \"birtherism\" campaign against Obama.\n",
      "While it is shocking to see such open racism expressed by a President of the United States, Sunday's tweets were far from the first time that Trump has dealt in such toxicity in office.\n",
      "He has painted a picture of hordes of criminals mobbing the US southern border in an invasion force of undocumented migrants. He has said America can't take any more immigrants because it is \"full.\" He reportedly referred to some African nations as \"sh**hole countries and expressed a preference for more immigrants from Norway — a predominantly white nation.\n",
      "The debate about whether Trump is a \"racist\" that pops up after such comments seems increasingly academic.\n",
      "Ahead of ICE raids, NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio says Trump trying to 'divide' America\n",
      "Democratic politicians, including Ocasio-Cortez and Pelosi were quick to condemn Trump's tweets. In the short-term, they might have backfired politically for Trump by helping soothe antagonism in the two wings of the House Democratic caucus.\n",
      "Democratic presidential candidates also were quick to condemn Trump, as his remarks played directly into their narrative that he abhors American values and is unfit to be President.\n",
      "\"America's strength is and has always been rooted in our diversity. But President Trump continues to spew hateful rhetoric, sow division, and stoke racial tensions for his own political gain,\" Democratic front runner Joe Biden tweeted.\n",
      "New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker told CNN: \"This president is hurting our country and bigotry like he just spewed is something we need to end in this nation.\"\n",
      "Trump's base will stand firm\n",

      "The lesson of Trump's political career is that while his tweets will cause outrage — they will not measurably reshape the political environment in the short-term.\n",
      "Republicans who support Trump by margins of close to 90% in recent polls have long ago made peace with the President's outrageousness or are willing to look the other way as he implements a conservative agenda, especially in the courts.\n",
      "Trump's incessant catering to his base means he has little to fear politically from the modern Republican Party.\n",
      "Democrats condemn ICE raids as 'inhumane,' 'tear families apart'\n",
      "Media outrage at Trump's behavior will play into the persecution complex and hatred of political correctness that the President has made central to his appeal to his closest supporters. Trump's aides may start to deny the clear implications of his tweets and try to stir up new anti-media hatred in his base.\n",
      "During Trump's campaign in 2016 and in the early months of his presidency, some Republican leaders offered token criticism when he veered into flagrant racial rhetoric.\n",
      "But the political reality is that there is little to be gained -- and much to be lost from taking on the President directly for GOP lawmakers.\n",
      "The President has only one hope of winning reelection -- thanks to the way that he has conducted his presidency. He must hope his fired up political base will show up to the polls in greater numbers than voters supporting Democrats that he is painting as extreme and bent on a communist takeover.\n",
      "That's why Sunday's tweets are probably not a historical aberration but a taste of things to come. China's economic growth slumps to lowest in 27 years as the trade war hits White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said in an interview with CNBC on Friday that US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will travel to Beijing with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in the near future.\n",

      "But analysts say question marks remain over whether the two sides can reach a deal to remove tariffs introduced over the past 12 months.\n",
      "\"Uncertainty caused by the US-China trade war was an important factor and we think this will persist,\" said Tom Rafferty, principal economist, China at The Economist Intelligence Unit.\n",
      "\"Businesses remain skeptical that the two countries will reach a broader trade agreement and recognize that trade tensions may escalate again,\" he added.\n",
      "The global economy just dodged another bullet. But the US-China trade truce won't fix it\n",
      "The growth numbers come after China reported a fall in both exports and imports for the first six months of this year, indicating the toll the trade war is having on an economy already suffering from weaker domestic demand.\n",
      "China's exports fell 1.3% year-on-year for the first half in dollar terms, while imports dropped 7.3%.\n",
      "The country recorded a sharper decline in exports to the United States, which decreased 8.1% for the first six months of 2019. Imports from the United States plunged 30% year on year.\n",
      "The trade war and China's economic slowdown has already hit some of the world's biggest businesses.\n",
      "Apple's (AAPL) sales in China have tumbled. Its revenue in the Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, dropped 21.5% in the second quarter from the same period a year ago, to $10.22 billion. Greater China accounted for about 18% of Apple's total revenue.\n",
      "Global auto brands are also suffering as the world's largest car market slows further this year, following its first contraction in decades in 2018. Chinese consumers are less willing to make big ticket purchases in the uncertain environment, while a government campaign against deadly levels of pollution is also having an impact.\n",
      "China's car market fell off a cliff this year. It faces a long road back\n",
      "Still, the trade war is helping others at the same time it's hurting China's growth.\n",
      "Americans are buying more from suppliers in Vietnam, Taiwan, Bangladesh and South Korea as they try to avoid US tariffs on Chinese consumer goods, according to data released by the Census Bureau.\n",
      "Analysts expect Beijing to unveil more stimulus measures to stabilize growth, including boosting infrastructure spending and possible interest rate cuts by the country's central bank, the People's Bank of China. The US Federal Reserve has also signaled it may lower interest rates.\n",
      "\"While the PBOC has already delivered stimulus this year, markets are awaiting. .. additional measures, which will probably come if trade talks collapse,\" said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at Oanda. \"If talks steadily progress, we will still probably see the [bank] deliver fresh stimulus following the Fed's highly anticipated rate cut at the end of the month. \" Taiwan's Tsai Ing-wen warns against 'overseas forces' at beginning of US trip Outside her New York hotel, clashes broke out between pro-Taipei and pro-Beijing protesters, Taiwan's official news agency CNA reported.\n",
      "Tsai's extended stay, which comes amid a protracted trade dispute between the US and China, risks inflaming tensions and furthering the perception that the White House is seeking to bolster ties with Taipei.\n",
      "On Monday the US State Department approved the potential sale of more than $2 billion in tanks and anti-air missiles to the Taiwan military, sparking a furious reaction from Beijing.\n",

      "Taiwan has been self-ruled since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, which saw the Communist Party take control of the mainland and the Nationalist government forced to flee to the island.\n",
      "Tsai's 12-day itinerary is aimed at shoring up relations with four Caribbean nations that continue to formally recognize the government in Taipei and not Beijing, and includes stops in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia and Haiti.\n",
      "In a speech prior to her departure from Taiwan early Thursday, Tsai pledged to use the trip to increase international cooperation. \"Freedom, democracy and sustainability are the Taiwanese values we want to share with all our good friends in the world,\" said Tsai. \"We will by no means restrict ourselves to a small corner of the Taiwan Strait.\"\n",
      "Though the US broke formal diplomatic relations with Taipei in 1979, it continues to maintain close ties with Taiwan.\n",
      "In May, US National Security Adviser John Bolton met with one of Taiwan's top defense officials, David Lee, the first meeting between the top security advisers of both governments since the formal split.\n",
      "\"Our interest in Taiwan, especially as it relates to these military sales, is to promote peace and stability across the straits, across the region,\" US State Department spokesman Morgan Ortagus said in advance of Tsai's arrival in New York, Tuesday.\n",
      "\"There's no change, of course, in our longstanding 'One China' policy,\" added Ortagus, referencing the policy under which Washington officially recognizes the Communist government in Beijing as the only legal government of China.\n",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has regularly called for the reunification of Taiwan with the mainland, even refusing to rule out force in a major speech in January.\n",
      "The Chinese military held live fire drills in the Taiwan Strait in 2018, while Chinese fighter jets crossed the maritime border separating the island from the mainland in a rare incursion in April.\n",
      "Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe told an audience in Singapore in June that if anyone attempted to \"split\" Taiwan from China, \"the Chinese military has no choice but to fight at all costs for national unity.\"\n",
      "Tsai is currently faced with an uphill battle for re-election in elections scheduled for January, against an resurgent opposition Nationalist party -- known as Kuomintang -- and is said to have attempted to polish her anti-Beijing credentials in a bid to win votes. China interrupts Hong Kong pop star during UN speech Ho ended her speech by asking the UN to convene an urgent session to \"protect the people of Hong Kong\" and remove China from the UN Human Rights Council.\n",
      "Weeks of protest\n",
      "Hong Kongers have been protesting in huge numbers over the past month against a controversial bill that critics say will put political activists and business people at risk of being extradited to mainland China.\n",
      "The Hong Kong government says the bill merely closes a loophole to allow suspected criminals to be extradited to territories where it doesn't have formal extradition deals, including Taiwan, Macau and mainland China.\n",
      "After the protests, Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam suspended the bill. While she didn't give a timeline for the resumption of debate on the legislation, she indicated that it was unlikely to pass this year.\n",

      "The Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency said that the tank sale serves \"US national, economic, and security interests by supporting\" Taiwan's \"continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.\" The agency also said that the Stinger missile sale would improve the security and defensive capability of Taiwan, which it called \"an important force for political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region.\"\n",
      "Neither sale, the agency said, would \"alter the basic military balance in the region.\"\n",
      "While the US has long provided arms to Taiwan as part of the 40-year-old Taiwan Relations Act, Beijing has long chaffed at those sales.\n",

      "\"Although China advocates for peaceful unification with Taiwan, China has never renounced the use of military force, and continues to develop and deploy advanced military capabilities needed for a potential military campaign,\" a report from the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency warned in May.\n",
      "The report also warned that Taiwan's traditional military advantages over Beijing in the event of a cross-strait conflict were eroding in the face of China's military modernization efforts.\n",
      "\"Taiwan has historically enjoyed military advantages in the context of a cross-Strait conflict, such as technological superiority and the inherent geographic advantages of island defense, China's multi-decade military modernization effort has eroded or negated many of these advantages,\" the report added, saying that \"although Taiwan is taking important steps to compensate for the growing disparities ... these improvements only partially address Taiwan's declining defensive advantages.\"\n",
      "Since 2010, the US has announced more than $15 billion in arms sales to Taiwan.\n",
      "The US has also been locked in a long running trade dispute with Beijing. On Sunday, President Donald Trump told reporters that \"we're doing very well with China\" and that his administration's imposition of tariffs on China had helped the negotiations.

      "\"This is a major change,\" he adds, noting that such bases used to be thought of as \"sanctuaries well outside Chinese strike range.\"\n",
      "Underscoring the seriousness of the matter, a 2018 report from the RAND Corp. think tank recommended joint US-Australia air defense exercises as a deterrent against any possible action from China.\n",
      "US and Australian forces regularly train together in Darwin, and as recently as May US and Royal Australian Airforce (RAAF) pilots took part in a bilateral training exercise off Australia's Northern Territory.\n",
      "An extra 1,000 miles of range\n",
      "Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain and instructor at Hawaii Pacific University, says that having runways in the South China Sea effectively adds more than 1,000 miles to the range of China's biggest bombers, the H-6K.\n",
      "Those aircraft can be armed with long-range cruise missiles, which allow the bombers to stay out of the reach of anti-aircraft defenses.\n",
      "Schuster makes another point -- one that didn't necessarily apply in the case of Saipan, but certainly looms large 75 years later. While in 1944, the US had one specific enemy in this region -- Japan -- in 2019, China seeks to exert influence over a range of countries.\n",
      "\"By controlling the South China Sea, China can project its air and sea power to the Pacific Ocean's western entry points, Malacca, Sundra and Lombok Straits,\" Schuster says.\n",
      "The means China can \"ensure entry and exit of its maritime forces and commerce to and from the Indian Ocean, through which 45% of China's exports and 60% of raw material imports must pass,\" he adds.\n",

      "The influence of those runways and military facilities also pushes northwards.\n",
      "\"That control also extends China's defensive buffer to the southeast by nearly 600 miles, (and) all but ensures leverage against Japan and Taiwan, since those waters are critical to those countries' economies,\" Schuster says.\n",
      "China says the runways and military assets it has installed in the South China Sea are for defense purposes only, to protect what it claims is its sovereign territory.\n",
      "Last weekend. China tested an anti-ship missile near the Spratly Islands, in the southern reaches of these waters, and in June it sent J-10 fighters to a deployment on Woody Island in the Paracels.\n",

      "Schuster said the deployment of those fighter jets sent a much broader message.\n",
      "\"It ... makes a statement that they can extend their air power reach over the South China Sea as required or desired,\" he said.\n",
      "Supply chains\n",
      "While small islands can help a country project power with aircraft and missiles, they also offer a more mundane but vital advantage for any military -- something Saipan gave the Americans in World War II: a place to shorten the supply chain and stage ground forces.\n",
      "Saipan, for example, became a vital way to support US operations on islands closer to the Japanese mainland, such as Okinawa, making those campaigns easier to sustain. In the South China Sea, island facilities could give PLA ships safe harbors where they can rest and replenish without going back to bases on the Chinese mainland.\n",

      "While no one is contending that any conflict -- let alone one on the scale of World War II -- is an imminent risk in the South China Sea, China's islands would give it a distinct advantage in the event of war.\n",
      "And, as Japan failed to recover from the losses sustained on Saipan in 1944, some wonder if it's too late for the US and its allies and partners in Asia to reverse the gains China has made by constructing the islands.\n",

      "\"I had a micro studio that was $1,750 per month,\" says Johnson. \"It was less than 200 square feet. This is actually a luxury and costs less than the place that I lived a couple blocks down the street.\"\n",

      "Although PodShare may seem a lot like a hostel (bunk beds in a shared room, for example), the company prefers to call it co-living.\n",
      "PodShare may not have as much privacy as an apartment, says Rayyan Zahid, 23, a software engineer living in San Francisco, but that's not a priority for him at the moment. \"What does matter is if I'm in the right place and surrounded by the right people and if it is efficient.\"\n",
      "PodShare allows him to live close to work, eliminating the two-hour commute time he would have if he'd moved to a suburb he could afford.\n",
      "As an immigrant from Pakistan, Zahid says he struggled with all of the requirements to get an apartment.\n",
      "\"I was trying to find a place to rent,\" he says. \"But I needed to have a credit score. I needed to have my tax records. Just stuff like that. If you study here, you might have some of those things. But if you're immigrating, you will most definitely not have those things.\"\n",

      "Elvina Beck, PodShare's 34-year-old founder, says that she created these spaces because this is the way she wanted to live -- meeting new people, traveling to new places -- but she's gratified that it provides a safe solution for others who have few options.\n",
      "\"Maybe they don't have two months' rent to put down or they don't have proof of income,\" she says. \"Whether it's from a divorce or their family kicked them out for being gay or because they're in a different country or a different city.\"\n",
      "She says when she launched the company in 2012, tenants were mostly 24 to 30, but now the typical age has pushed up to late 20s and early 30s. And while the typical user is a young person starting out or moving to a new city, there are older adults who are trying out a new city and even business travelers.\n",
      "A home of her own -- with others\n",
      "Beck, who is also a resident of PodShare and moves among the different locations, has her sights set on a larger affordable housing solution: membership-based housing in the cloud.\n",

      "Ultimately her vision is global: \"The goal is to empower the global citizen and live anywhere across the world for one monthly price. A $1,000 a month [membership] should get you a chance to live from here to Taiwan back to Boston. You cover the flight and we'll cover the housing. It's all included.\"\n",

      "In 2010, when Beck was struggling to find production work in LA, she was having a hard time finding an affordable place to live near her freelance gigs in Hollywood.\n",
      "She had an idea to scale up the roommate model to a higher density so that the cost of living in an appealing location could be as low as possible. She figured, why not also split up some costs of toiletries and basic food staples, too?\n",
      "When she told her dad she was going to use her savings to build a co-living space and asked him to come to LA to help her build the adult-sized bunk-beds she calls pods, he didn't think it was a great idea.\n",
      "\"People don't want to live with strangers,'\" Beck recalled him saying. \" 'They want privacy. They want lots of space themselves. You're basically taking away everything that people want.' \"\n",
      "But she pushed back and told him that in desirable urban areas, privacy and space are things people are willing to give up in order to be where the action is.\n",
      "And the community component is critical.\n",

      "September 7, 2014 - The German newspaper Die Welt publishes an interview with the Dalai Lama in which he suggests ending the tradition of choosing a spiritual leader for the Tibetan people. The article sparks discussions about whether the Dalai Lama was declaring that he will not be reincarnated. He later clarifies his comments during an interview with the BBC, saying that it is \"up to the Tibetan people\" whether another Dalai Lama will arise after his death.\n",
      "May 6, 2016 - The New York Times reports the launch of the Atlas of Emotions, a project commissioned by the Dalai Lama. Created by psychologist Paul Ekman for $750,000, it is reportedly a \"map of emotions\" that aims to help people find inner peace.\n",

      "March 22, 2018 - Sonam Dagpo, spokesperson for the Central Tibetan Administration announces that the \"His Holiness is invited to different countries but he has cut down public engagements because of age. He is exhausted after teaching for a long period of time. Therefore a few commitments have been canceled.\"\n",
      "April 9, 2019 - Aides announce that the Dalai Lama has been hospitalized with a chest infection, but is in stable condition. He is discharged two days later. These are 4 winners of the US-China trade war Trump said last week that talks are \"back on track\" and new tariffs are on hold after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 conference in Japan.\n",
      "But American business owners were startled in May when the administration escalated tariffs on $200 billion of goods to 25% from 10%, arguing that China reneged on previous agreements. Trump also threatened to impose new tariffs on the remaining Chinese imports, which would hit smartphones, toys, footwear and fish.\n",
      "The president has suggested that Beijing will agree to a deal because the tariffs he's imposed on Chinese goods are driving away business.\n",
      "\"China is getting absolutely decimated by companies that are leaving China, going to other countries, including our own,\" he said in an interview with CNBC last month.\n",
      "But it's unclear whether companies are permanently shifting production outside of China, or simply rerouting goods for minimal processing before being shipped to the United States. Vietnam's customs agency said that it would start cracking down on goods of Chinese origin illegally relabeled \"Made in Vietnam\" by businesses attempting to avoid the US tariffs, according to a report from Reuters.\n",
      "It's not always easy to find suppliers outside of China that can manufacture the same good with the same quality and for a cheaper price. It's a process that could take months, or even years. Instead, an importer may decide to eat the cost, betting that Trump will lift the tariffs sooner rather than later. They can also choose to pass the cost on to consumers for the time being.\n",
      "Missouri-based Cap America imports a majority of its baseball caps from China and embroiders them in the United States. The company is trying a new supplier in Bangladesh to avoid the tariffs, but those orders will only make up about 20% of total imports this year as they test the quality.\n",
      "\"You can't just snap your fingers and switch production. It's a definite process,\" said CEO Phil Page.\n",
      "About 40% of companies surveyed in May by the American Chamber of Commerce and its counterpart in Shanghai said they are considering or have already relocated some manufacturing outside of China because of the tariffs. For those that have moved production, about a quarter shifted to Southeast Asia. Fewer than 6% said they have relocated or are considering relocating to the United States.\n",
      "While imports from countries outside China have significantly increased this year, some production was already moving outside of China to places with even lower wages long before Trump began imposing tariffs. US imports from countries like Vietnam and South Korea have been steadily increasing over the past decade as those countries have ramped up manufacturing of apparel and electronics, respectively.\n",
      "Taiwan and South Korea are more focused on high-tech items like semiconductors, but Vietnam and Bangladesh still offer competitive wages — making them attractive places to make consumer items like apparel and shoes.\n",

      "To reinforce its claim, China has created and fortified artificial islands in the chain in the southern part of the South China Sea, despite a pledge made by President Xi Jinping during a White House visit in 2015 that the islands would not become military outposts.\n",
      "\"What's truly disturbing about this act is that it's in direct contradiction to President Xi's statement ... that he would not militarize those man-made outposts,\" Eastburn said Tuesday.\n",
      "Ballistic missile can hit moving ships, China says, but experts remain skeptical\n",
      "\"I'm not going to speak on behalf of all the sovereign nations in the region, but I'm sure they agree that (China's) behavior is contrary to its claim to want to bring peace to the region and obviously actions like this are coercive acts meant to intimidate other (South China Sea) claimants,\" Eastburn added.\n",
      "But it's not just China that is flexing military muscles in the South China Sea. The US and its allies and partners are beefing up their presence in the region.\n",

      "At the weekend, the US Navy announced the littoral combat ship USS Montgomery was making a port call in Davao, Philippines. The shallow-draft ship, designed for action near shorelines and around islands, is expected to be headed to Singapore as part of a stated US Navy plan to put forward-deploy two ships there this year.\n",
      "As US and China spar, the rest of Asia risks being stuck in the middle\n",
      "Meanwhile, warships from Australia, Canada and France have been in and around the South China Sea during the last 12-months, as the US encourages allies to support a free and open Indo-Pacific region.\n",
      "Tensions have been especially high in the Spratlys in the past month, after a Philippine fishing boat sank following a collision with a Chinese fishing boat on June 9.\n",
      "The Filipino fishermen claimed they were left to drown by the Chinese boat and were only rescued hours later by a Vietnamese boat. China claims its vessel felt threatened by swarming Philippine boats.\n",
      "The incident was enough for Manila to register a diplomatic protest with Beijing, though the government of President Rodrigo Duterte so far appears to be reluctant to push Beijing too hard on the issue.

      "What happened: Protesters stormed and vandalized the legislative building in Hong Kong. These protesters broke away from the annual July 1 march that marks the anniversary of when Hong Kong was given to China. There were other demonstrations that remained peaceful.\n",
      "Why they were protesting: People were protesting a bill that would allow China to extradite Hong Kong citizens. Critics worry China would use the bill to prosecute people for political reasons and that it would erode freedoms people in Hong Kong have.\n",
      "Where the bill stands now: The city's Chief Executive Carrie Lam, speaking at a news conference, said that she doesn't intend to continue debating the bill, and that it will expire in July 2020 at the end of the term.\n",
      "What happens next: Protesters have made several demands — the complete withdrawal of the extradition bill is only one of them. They are also calling for Lam to step down as well as an investigation into police brutality, a retraction of the characterization of the protests as riots and the release of arrested protesters.\n",

      "Now occupying a four-story building, the venue has expanded beyond nighttime entertainment to include a fully programed community center, offering everything from yoga and dance classes to free HIV testing. A spacious multi-room gallery called Art.Des can be found on the third floor.\n",
      "\"I thought it would be a good idea to use the space to do something different for the LGBTQ community,\" said Destination's co-owner, Edmund Yang. \"Through this platform, people can have another perspective on what LGBTQ people are like.\"\n",
      "The gay businessman described the initial public reaction to Art.Des as a pleasant surprise, for the most part. But he noted that prejudices remain, citing an incident in which several artists were pressured by friends to pull out of a show due to Destination being a \"gay venue.\"\n",
      "The new generation of Chinese collectors shaking up the art world\n",
      "Admitting his own lack of artistic expertise, Yang says he aims to turn Art.Des into an \"inclusive\" space but relies on his friend Pierre Alivon, a French artist, to curate work for the gallery. The current exhibition, \"Love Is Love,\" visualizes the title theme through paintings, photographs and sculptures to coincide with the LGBTQ Pride Month, which takes place globally throughout June.\n",
      "Expressing a preference for work by struggling young Chinese artists, Alivon said that the public's lack of understanding of queer-themed art poses a challenge to curators.\n",
      "\"People would just call me and say, 'I'm gay, I'm an artist ... I paint gay sex' and expect to be selected,\" he said.\n",

      "The plan to take Taiwan\n",
      "China's Taiwan invasion plan, known internally as the \"Joint Island Attack Campaign,\" would begin with a mass, coordinated bombing of Taiwan's vital infrastructure -- ports and airfields -- to cripple the island's military ahead of an amphibious invasion, according to both Easton and Sidharth Kaushal, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies.\n",
      "At the same time, the Chinese air force would fly over the Taiwan Strait and try to dominate the island's air space. Once the PLA was satisfied it had suitably disabled Taiwan's air and naval forces, Kaushal said soldiers would begin to invade on the west coast of the island.\n",
      "The island's rocky, mountainous east coast is considered too inhospitable and far from mainland China.\n",
      "The amphibious invasion needed to put troops on Taiwan, however, could be the biggest hurdle facing the PLA.\n",
      "In its 2019 report to Congress, the US Department of Defense said China -- which has one of the largest navies in Asia -- had at its command 37 amphibious transport docks and 22 smaller landing ships, as well as any civilian vessels Beijing could enlist.\n",
      "That might be enough to occupy smaller islands, such as those in the South China Sea, but an amphibious assault on Taiwan would likely require a bigger arsenal -- and there is \"no indication China is significantly expanding its landing ship force,\" the report said.\n",

      "Essentially, that's only about 10 to 15 ships, he added.\n",
      "If they did make it across the strait, the PLA would still need to find a decent landing spot for its ships.\n",
      "China's military would be looking for a landing site both close to the mainland, and a strategic city, such as Taipei, with nearby port and airport facilities.\n",

      "Chinese troops could be dropped in from the air, but a lack of paratroopers in the PLA makes it unlikely.\n",
      "If the PLA held a position on Taiwan, and could reinforce with troops from the mainland to face off about 150,000 Taiwan troops, as well as more than 2.5 million reservists, it would have to push through the island's western mud flats and mountains, with only narrow roads to assist them, towards Taipei.\n",

      "The appearance of the J-10s on Woody Island comes just over a year after China sent its H-6K long-range bombers to the island for test flights for the first time.\n",
      "The PLA claimed that mission was a part of China's aim to achieve a broader regional reach, quicker mobilization, and greater strike capabilities.\n",
      "\"The islands in the South China Sea are China's territory,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said after the bomber flights. \"The relevant military activities are normal trainings and other parties shouldn't over-interpret them.\"\n",
      "A military expert, Wang Mingliang, was quoted in a Chinese statement as saying the training would hone the Chinese air force's war-preparation skills and its ability to respond to various security threats in the region.\n",
      "In 2017, a report in China's state-run Global Times, said fighter jets -- J-11s -- were deployed to Woody Island for the first time, with the new hangars able to protect the warplanes from the island's high heat and humidity.\n",
      "That report said such hangars would be useful on other Chinese islands to greatly enhance Beijing's control over the South China Sea. Fact-checking Trump's ABC interview Facts First: Trump is rewriting history. The Veterans Choice Program was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2014 and was co-sponsored by Senator John McCain. Trump signed a bill to continue the program and eventually consolidated other programs under the new Veterans Community Care Program.\n",
      "Veterans Choice aimed to expand veteran's access to health care by increasing the number of medical staff in the VA system as well as allowing those who met certain criteria (either from wait time or distance to a VA facility) to see doctors outside of the VA system.\n",
      "The bill signed by Trump in June of 2018, the VA MISSION Act, will consolidate several different VA health programs into the new Veterans Community Care Program. The program was set to start this summer, and for the year between the VA MISSION Act provided $5.2 billion to continue the Veterans Choice Program. The bill also expanded veteran's ability to take their VA benefits to private doctors.\n",
      "Tariffs\n",
      "When Stephanopoulos asserted that Americans are paying for the tariffs on China, Trump retorted \"No, they're not.\"\n",
      "\"China subsidizes their product in order to keep people working,\" Trump said before going on to argue that many companies were also moving out of China in order to avoid the tariffs. \"So there is no tariff.\"\n",
      "Facts First: Trump is flatly wrong on this notion. US consumers and companies pay a large chunk of the tariffs Trump has placed on China. In addition, while there is evidence that US importers are shifting part of their production outside China, there isn't much to suggest there's a mass exodus of companies relocating away from China.\n",
      "Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that 40% of the cost of tariffs has been passed on to consumers, with producers and retailers taking on the rest.\n",
      "According to a study from economists at Princeton, Columbia and the New York Federal Reserve, by the end of 2018 US companies and consumers were paying $3 billion a month more, plus $1.4 billion in additional losses, because of these new tariffs, mostly on China.\n",
      "In their Economic Report published in March, Trump's own administration admitted that despite any \"benefits\" which the tariffs may have are offset by the \"costs paid by consumers in the form of higher prices and reduced consumption.\" So yes, Americans are paying these tariffs.\n",
      "As for Trump's claim that companies are fleeing China to avoid paying tariffs, it's difficult to measure how prevalent that trend is. Or if it's even happening at all.\n",
      "US imports from countries outside of China have increased in the first four months of 2019 compared to last year: 22% from Taiwan, 17% from South Korea, 38% from Vietnam, and 13% from Bangladesh. But part of this increase could be part of an already upward trend of importing more from countries outside of China and from the strong US economy, which leads to higher imports overall.\n",
      "US Census Bureau trade data published this month noted that US importers are taking in 12% less from China this year. While this is a significant number it's difficult to argue that \"many\" companies are moving out of China. Additionally, there are a large number of products made exclusively in China due to the interdependence of global supply chains.\n",
      "As Facts First has previously noted, for example, many raw materials integral to the US chemical industry now fall under Trump's tariffs and are \"unavailable outside of China,\" Jennifer Abril, president of the Society of Chemical Manufacturers & Affiliates told CNN in May.\n",
      "Clinton colluded\n",
      "Stephanopoulos pressed Trump on the most damning portions of the Mueller report, including the dozens of contacts between Trump's team and Russians. The report said numerous Trump associates were drawn into the Russian web and took meetings with Kremlin-tied figures who offered dirt on Hillary Clinton, but they did not cross the line into a criminal conspiracy.\n",
      "In his answer, Trump ignored these findings and attacked his 2016 opponent.\n",
      "\"What about Hillary Clinton?\" Trump asked. \"Hillary Clinton conspired with Russia. She had somebody that came out of Russia. They got information from Russia. Excuse me. Hillary Clinton was totally involved with it. If you talk about collusion with Russia take a look at Christopher Steele, all his contacts with Russia which by the way she paid for, and turned out to be a phony deal, which everyone is now admitting that. No George, all I want is the truth.\"\n",
      "Facts First: Trump is lying about Clinton by making up allegations that she colluded with the Russians in 2016. He's also twisting the facts about the Steele dossier, and is creating a false equivalency between his team's contacts with Russians and Clinton's ties to the dossier.\n",
      "For starters, there is absolutely no evidence that \"Clinton conspired with Russia\" like Trump claimed. Mueller's mandate was to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election and whether any Americans - not just Trump aides -- were involved in those efforts.\n",
      "The report said nothing about connections between the Clinton campaign and the Russian government or the Internet Research Agency, the Kremlin-connected troll farm that spread propaganda to US audiences.\n",
      "Trump then turned to the infamous Steele dossier, the series of private intelligence memos that former British spy Christopher Steele wrote in the final months of the 2016 campaign.\n",
      "The memos contained details about Russian meddling that pre-dated public announcements about Russia's activities by the US government. They also alleged that Trump colluded with the Kremlin. Some claims have been debunked, while others have held up over time; some remain unproven while others are partially true. Trump is wrong when he says it was all \"phony.\"\n",
      "One of the main claims in the Steele dossier -- that the Trump campaign engaged in a widespread conspiracy of collusion with the Russians -- was not established by Mueller.\n",
      "But the President is wrong that Steele is \"somebody that came out of Russia.\" Steele is a British citizen. He lived in Russia as an undercover spy, but his allegiance was to the United Kingdom. The UK is one of America's closest allies for intelligence-sharing. Steele's strong track record made him a trusted and valuable informant for the FBI and other US government agencies.\n",
      "Trump is also wrong that Clinton \"was totally involved\" in the Steele dossier. There is no evidence that she was directly involved, and her campaign chairman testified to Congress that he didn't know about it before the 2016 election. But Clinton's campaign funded Steele's work. They paid a law firm, which hired an opposition research company, which brought on Steele.\n",
      "On Monday morning, Clinton tweeted a response to Trump's claims she colluded with Russia, calling them \"outlandish.\"\n",
      "Rebuffing Russian outreach\n",
      "Trump mischaracterized a key finding from the Mueller report. He claimed: \"Mueller said that we rebuffed Russia, that we pushed them away, that we weren't interested. Read the report.\"\n",
      "Facts First: This is only half the story, and it is a very misleading representation of the Mueller report. Trump omitted the part where Mueller said that some members of Trump's campaign eagerly accepted meetings with Russians and even solicited their help on the 2016 election.\n",
      "Here's what the Mueller report said about this: \"In sum, the investigation established multiple links between Trump Campaign officials and individuals tied to the Russian government. Those links included Russian offers of assistance to the Campaign. In some instances, the Campaign was receptive to the offer, while in other instances the Campaign officials shied away.\"\n",
      "This isn't the first time Trump made this misleading claim. The whole truth is much more nuanced. Sometimes the Russians were rebuffed, sometimes they were welcomed. Trump's own son, Donald Trump Jr., eagerly took a meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016 after being told that she was bringing damaging information about Clinton on behalf of the Kremlin.\n",
      "Ultimately, the investigation did not establish that any of these contacts broke the law.\n",
      "Cooperation with Mueller\n",
      "Defending his response to the Mueller investigation, Trump said he was \"the most transparent in history\" and touted the fact that he provided Mueller with 1.5 million pages of documents. He also said \"I gave them four or five hundred witnesses\" to be interviewed by investigators.\n",
      "Facts First: It's true that Trump gave Mueller's team broad access to interview White House officials and read their internal notes, which proved pivotal to the investigation. But that group represents only a small slice of the 500 witnesses Mueller interviewed. And perhaps most importantly, Trump refused multiple requests from investigators for a sit-down interview.\n",
      "Whenever Trump touts his \"transparency\" with the Mueller investigation, he never mentions his adamant refusal to agree to a sit-down interview. While Trump made his aides available for interviews, he agreed only to answer written questions about collusion, but not obstruction. Mueller made it clear that Trump's responses were \"incomplete\" and generally insufficient.\n",
      "There are many other reasons why Trump is not \"the most transparent\" president in US history, including his refusal to release his tax returns and his fight to block Congressional subpoenas to gain access to his financial statements.\n",
      "Trump also exaggerated the number of witnesses he \"gave\" to Mueller so they could testify.\n",
      "Mueller interviewed 500 witnesses, but Trump could only control the testimony of White House aides. More than two dozen Trump administration officials voluntarily gave interviews to the special counsel. The fruits of those interviews created the foundation of the obstruction inquiry.\n",
      "Federal investigators interviewed hundreds of people Trump didn't have any control over. For example, Mueller's team spoke to Russian banker Petr Aven, conservative author and conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi, and the translator at the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting.\n",
      "However, to Trump's credit, he did not invoke executive privilege or go to court to prevent Mueller's team from interviewing White House aides of reviewing their documents.\n",
      "Trump says Putin helped Clinton\n",
      "Trump claimed the Russians \"were also helping the Clinton campaign,\" and later said Russian President Vladimir Putin \"would much rather have Hillary Clinton be president right now.\"\n",
      "Facts First: Trump is entitled to his own views. But he stands alone in his belief that the Russians tried to help Clinton's campaign in 2016. The US intelligence community announced after the 2016 election that the Kremlin tried to help Trump, a conclusion that has been endorsed by all of Trump's handpicked officials to lead the intelligence agencies.\n",
      "The stunning assessment that the Russian government tried to help Trump was made public in a January 2017 report featured unanimous conclusions from the FBI, the CIA and the National Security Agency. The report was prepared during the Obama administration but Trump's appointees to lead these US intelligence agencies have endorsed the report and its findings.\n",
      "This isn't about collusion or coordination with the campaign. It's about the wide-ranging Russian campaign to influence Americans, largely in Trump's favor. For instance, Facebook acknowledged that Russian propaganda reached 126 million Americans on its platform both before and after the election.\n",
      "The Russians hacked Democratic targets and released their emails through WikiLeaks at pivotal moments in the campaign, including days before the Democratic National Convention and after the leak of the Access Hollywood tape that featured Trump making offensive comments about women. These hacks, carried out by Russian military officers, gave Trump a massive boost.\n",
      "Trump on Russian 'bloggers'\n",
      "On four occasions in his ABC interview, Trump used the word \"bloggers\" to describe Russian hackers.\n",
      "\"They also said that there were bloggers in Moscow,\" Trump said. \"And they said specifically about the bloggers in Moscow, had nothing to do with Trump, had nothing to do with -- and there were like 32 or 36 bloggers. We have nothing to do with bloggers in Moscow.\"\n",
      "Facts First: They weren't bloggers. They were sophisticated hackers who worked for the Russian military, according to court filings. Trump's language downplays the seriousness of their actions, which Mueller himself described as \"a concerted attack on our political system.\"\n",
      "According to dictionary definitions, a blogger is someone who writes for a blog, which is an online publication or personal website that typically features commentary on a specific topic.\n",
      "The Russians hackers who meddled in the 2016 election were intelligence officers who worked for Russia's military intelligence agency, known as the GRU.\n",
      "\"Russian intelligence officers who were part of the Russian military launched a concerted attack on our political system,\" Mueller said in his only public statement about the investigation.\n",
      "Trump's comments diminish the role of the Russian government in the attack. Interestingly, Putin has also sought to distance the Russian state from the hacks, saying that \"patriotic hackers\" might have meddled in American politics, but they were not directed by the Kremlin.\n",
      "That's just not true, according to Mueller, whose office indicted a dozen GRU officers. They were accused of hacking Democratic targets in 2016 and sharing the spoils with WikiLeaks.\n",
      "Debates\n",
      "Stephanopoulos asked Trump how it was that several Republican senators who were initially skeptical of Trump eventually came around to support him. Trump pointed to the 2016 presidential debates and how, he said, \"they found out I am very smart and I know what I'm doing.\"\n",
      "\"I had, what, 15 debates and we won every debate,\" said Trump. \"According to every poll, I mean I can only tell you by the polls. But every poll, they had many polls, doing many debates, I never lost one poll, I think they've gained a certain respect.\"\n",
      "Facts First: Trump did not, according to polling, win every debate he participated in during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n",
      "In a Fox News poll on the first GOP presidential debate in August 2015, voters were asked who performed the best and worst during the debate. Fox News combined these scores, leaving Trump in last place with -13 points and Carly Fiorina in first with +12 points.\n",
      "Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who watched one or both of the back-to-back debates in September 2015, Trump came in third, with 11%, behind Marco Rubio (14%) and Carly Fiorina (52%), when respondents were asked which candidate did the best job during the debates, according to a CNN poll.\n",
      "During the December 2015 debate among GOP presidential hopefuls, Trump's luck changed. He came in first in a CNN poll, winning with 33% among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. (Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas came in second, behind by 5 points.)\n",
      "In a CBS News poll on the GOP debate in February 2016, Trump came in second (24%), behind Rubio (32%), among Republicans and independents who were asked what candidate they thought did the best job.\n",
      "Trump told Stephanopoulos that he won all 15 debates. Since there were 12 primary debates and three general debates, it would appear that Trump is also claiming that he won the three debates with Hillary Clinton.\n",
      "When looking at the three debates between Trump and Clinton, Clinton won all three debates, among all those polled by CNN. Among Republicans, however, Trump won all three debates, gradually going up from 55% to 68% and 74%, whereas, among Democrats, Clinton consistently stayed around 90%.\n",
      "Pre-existing conditions protections\n",
      "When Stephanopoulos asked the President whether his drive to overturn Obamacare equates to abandoning those with preexisting conditions, Trump denied it.\n",
      "\"Preexisting conditions-- I was for preexisting conditions. And I still-- you know, I'm very much for preexisting conditions,\" he said.\n",
      "Facts First: While Trump has continued to state his support for covering people with preexisting conditions, his administration is actively seeking to have Obamacare declared unconstitutional. This would eliminate the health care law's groundbreaking and very popular protections for those with less-than-perfect medical histories.\n",
      "The administration is siding with Texas and a coalition of Republican-led states that are challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act in federal court.\n",
      "The Department of Justice initially argued a year ago that two key Obamacare provisions were no longer valid because Congress effectively eliminated the individual mandate by reducing the penalty for not having insurance to $0.\n",
      "Those two provisions -- which ban insurers from denying coverage and from setting premiums based on health backgrounds -- overhauled the nation's health insurance industry and allowed millions of Americans to gain coverage.\n",
      "Under Attorney General William Barr, the department went even further in pushing to dismantle the law. In a filing with the federal appeals court in March, the Justice Department said it agreed with the December ruling of a federal judge in Texas that invalidated the entire Affordable Care Act. (The law remains in effect as the case works its way through the courts.)\n",
      "If Obamacare itself falls, it would also eliminate the provision that requires insurers to provide comprehensive policies that cover a wide range of treatments, another key component of the protections for those with preexisting conditions.\n",
      "A coalition of 21 blue states led by California is defending the law. The Democratic-led House of Representatives has joined the effort, painting the GOP as hurting those with preexisting conditions.\n",
      "The two sides are expected to argue before a panel of appellate judges in early July.\n",
      "Trump also said he's formulating a new GOP health care plan that will be better than Obamacare. But the bills that Congress came up with in 2017 in the Republicans' failed attempt to repeal and replace the law would have also chipped away at the protections for those with preexisting conditions.\n",
      "The so-called \"skinny repeal\" bill that the late Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona helped to nix would have given states more flexibility in requiring insurers to provide comprehensive policies. The President continues to criticize McCain's famous thumbs-down vote on the bill in July 2017\n",

      "Lam said Xi's authority, already \"dented\" by the prolonged US trade war, would be further questioned in Beijing in the wake of the Hong Kong protests. \"This is one more set back for Xi Jinping,\" he said.\n",

      "Hong Kong divides US and China\n",
      "Hong Kong is an unwanted headache for the Chinese leader less than two weeks before he is due to meet world leaders at the G20 summit in Osaka.\n",
      "Most importantly, though it has yet to be confirmed, Xi is also expected to meet face-to-face with US President Trump for the first time since trade talks collapsed at the beginning of May.\n",
      "Both sides blamed the other for the failure and, in response, the Trump administration raised tariffs to 25% on an estimated $200 billion of Chinese goods.\n",
      "Weakened by the trade war, Xi returns to security conference ready to woo Modi and Putin\n",
      "The Chinese government maintains it is not afraid of a trade war, but higher tariffs are an extra burden on an economy that's already showing signs of slowing.\n",
      "While both sides are trying to find a way forward, the Hong Kong protests have sparked another wave of antagonism and rhetoric between the US and China.\n",
      "After the initial protests, Secretary of State Pompeo expressed concern about the proposed extradition bill, while the US Congress has threatened new legislation which would downgrade Hong Kong's special status as a trading hub if Beijing doesn't stop infringing on the city's freedoms.\n",
      "That special status is significant. Hong Kong is allowed economic freedoms that are restricted to the rest of China, which, tied with an unbiased court system left over from the UK colonial period, have led to many large Western businesses basing their lucrative China operations out of the city.\n",
      "As more US businesses begin to look at investments outside of China, Hong Kong's role as the country's most economically liberal city is more important than ever.\n",
      "China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Friday that any attempts to instigate chaos in Hong Kong were bound to fail. \"We urge certain people in the US to respect basic facts, discard arrogance and prejudice, stop playing dirty tricks that meddle in Hong Kong affairs,\" said spokesman Geng Shuang.\n",
      "China expert Glaser said it wasn't unusual for Beijing to accuse the US of interfering in its domestic politics, a standard pattern which went back decades to the fall of the Soviet Union.\n",
      "But she added it wasn't out of the question for President Trump to see Hong Kong as a potential point of leverage in trade talks, similar to his handling of Taiwan relations or the export ban on Huawei.\n",
      "\"There's always a risk that he chooses to use Hong Kong as a bargaining chip,\" she said.\n",
      "'Over my dead body'\n",
      "The Hong Kong protests have also come during a heated presidential election campaign in Taiwan, which has increasingly been seen as a referendum on relations with mainland China.\n",
      "Taiwan and China have been separately governed since the end of a bloody civil war in 1949, and in the past decade Beijing has been attempting to woe the island back through a combination of promises and threats.\n",
      "President Tsai Ing-wen's Democratic Progressive Party has historically been seen as pro-independence, while the opposition Kuomintang have encouraged closer relations with the mainland.\n",
      "But in a sign that the Hong Kong protests are spreading, a leading opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate came out hard on Saturday against closer ties with the mainland.\n",
      "\"'One Country, Two Systems' can never be implemented in Taiwan. Taiwanese people can never accept it, unless it's over my dead body,\" presidential candidate Han Kuo-yu told a rally, referring to the special system of government used in Hong Kong.\n",
      "In response, the crowd chanted \"Reject 'One Country, Two Systems,\"' according to Taiwan news agency CNA.\n",
      "President Tsai herself has made regular statements in support of the Hong Kong protesters, clearly trying to burnish her anti-Beijing credentials ahead of the January vote.\n",
      "\"In their pursuit of democracy and freedom, the people of Hong Kong (are) not alone. Because we know that if you don't stand for something, you will fall for anything,\" the Taiwan leader said on her official Twitter feed on June 13.\n",
      "China expert Lam said if the rebellious Hong Kong spirit spread to Taiwan, or even further, it would be dire news of Beijing.\n",
      "\"Xi has been trying to intimidate the people of Taiwan by naked demonstrations of force, but now the Taiwan people can point to Hong Kong to say that if the Taiwan people are united against China, they can get away with it,\" said Lam. \"They can even force Beijing to make a compromise.\" Joshua Wong released from prison day after hundreds of thousands march in Hong Kong Wong added that he thought Beijing too must be looking at the chaos in Hong Kong -- amid the US-China trade war and other headaches for President Xi Jinping -- and wondering about Lam's future.\n",
      "\"Hong Kong is just a small international city with seven million citizens, but two million people came to the streets, it shows that we have the consensus,\" he said. \"She has to end her political career.\"\n",
      "Wong predicted that if the bill is not fully withdrawn and key officials resign, then protests could continue, particularly on July 1, the anniversary of the city's handover from British to Chinese rule and a key annual date for pro-democracy marches.\n",
      "One of Wong's first actions Monday was to pay his respects at a memorial in Admiralty, near the main site of the protests, where a man fell to his death Saturday after climbing a shopping mall and displaying signs calling for the withdrawal of the extradition bill.\n",
      "Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong (left), who was just released from jail, walks past flower tributes at a makeshift memorial site for a protester who fell to his death while hanging banners against a controversial extradition law proposal on June 15, in Hong Kong on June 17, 2019.\n",

      "In a statement Saturday after Lam said she was suspending passage of the controversial bill. Demosisto said Hong Kongers should \"demand that the bill be shelved for good, stand against political prosecution of protesters, condemn police brutality, and call for Lam's resignation.\"\n",
      "\"That Lam continues to blame the bill's widespread opposition as a result of Hong Kongers' misunderstanding of it is also condescending,\" Demosisto said Saturday. \"Our movement may have won a battle, but the war is not yet over. We urge the international community not to turn away.\"\n",
      "Wong appeared cognizant of that community in his statements Monday, speaking in Cantonese, English and Mandarin. He also thanked supporters in Taiwan, where the Hong Kong protests have become a major issue in the island's presidential election, creating yet another headache for Beijing.\n",
      "Born in 1996, eight months before control of Hong Kong was handed over from the UK to China, Wong has spent most of his adolescence and all of his early adulthood fighting for the city's rights against what he and others say is increasing encroachment by Beijing.\n",
      "A student leader during 2014's Occupy protests -- which called for universal suffrage in Hong Kong -- Wong became something of an international figurehead for the movement, and even appeared on the cover of Time magazine. His role in the protests later became the subject of the 2017 Netflix documentary, \"Teenager vs. Superpower.\" Hong Kong protest sees hundreds of thousands call for city's leader to step down What we covered here\n",
      "What we covered here\n",
      "What happened: Organizers estimated that 2 million people hit the streets in Hong Kong to protest a controversial China extradition bill, despite the government announcing the legislation would be \"suspended\" on Saturday.\n",
      "Protesters' demands: The crowd called for the extradition bill to be withdrawn permanently. Many also wanted Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam to step down over her handling of the incident.\n",
      "City grounds to a halt: Streets in downtown Hong Kong were awash with protesters, with crowds unable to move as thousands continue to join the march.\n",

      "Nearly 2 million protesters in Hong Kong, organizers claim\n",
      "From CNN's Lindsay Isaac\n",
      "Close to 2 million people descended on Hong Kong's streets on Sunday, Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), the organizers of the protests, estimate.\n",
      "According to CHRF, those numbers are unprecedented. Police estimated that the 338,000 people followed the protest's original route.\n",
      "In a statement released by the group Sunday night, CHRF said demonstrations will continue until the government withdraws the extradition bill in its entirety, releases arrested protesters and withdraws all charges, retracts the characterization of the protests as a \"riot\" and forces Chief Executive Carrie Lam to resign.\n",
      "\"Should the government refuse to respond, only more Hong Kongers will strike tomorrow,\" CHRF said.\n",
      "A slow shutter image shows thousands of people taking part in protests in Hong Kong on Sunday.\n",

      "Pro-democracy protest leader to be released from jail\n",
      "Joshua Wong, the young leader of Hong Kong’s 2014 “Umbrella” movement, will be released from prison on Monday, according to his pro-democracy political party Demosisto.\n",
      "The news broke amid historic demonstrations against a China extradition bill Sunday night.\n",
      "Wong, who spent much of 2017 in prison for his role in the protests and was sent back last month for contempt of court, has called for the scrapping of government proposals aimed at easing extradition of wanted suspects to mainland China.\n",
      "Joshua Wong speaks to tens of thousands protesters outside the government headquarters in Hong Kong, in September 2012.\n",
      "In an opinion piece penned for Time magazine earlier this week, Wong said that Hong Kong’s extradition law would be a “victory for authoritarianism everywhere” and urged the United States to act.\n",
      "“As American security and business interests are also jeopardized by possible extradition arrangements with China, I believe the time is ripe for Washington to re-evaluate the U.S.–Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, which governs relations between the two places. I also urge Congress to consider the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The rest of the international community should make similar efforts,” Wong wrote.\n",

      "“Do You Hear The People Sing?,” a song from musical Les Misérables and the anthem of Hong Kong protests in 2014, has resurfaced in demonstrations over the controversial China extradition bill.\n",
      "A large group of demonstrators belted out the song in unison under a footbridge next to the police headquarters Sunday afternoon in Hong Kong. Crowds circling the singers cheered: \"Encore!\"\n",
      "The rousing chorus: “Do you hear the people sing?/Singing the songs of angry men?/It is the music of the people/Who will not be slaves again!” is sung in the musical as students prepare to launch an anti-monarchist rebellion in the streets of Paris.\n",
      "In recent years it has been picked up as the soundtrack for demonstrations from Ukraine to the US.\n",

      "Hong Kong leader admits government \"deficiencies\" had disappointed the people\n",
      "Faced with yet another huge protest over her handling of the China extradition bill, Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam issued a rare apology Sunday night.\n",
      "Hours after the demonstrations started, the government said in a statement that Lam had admitted \"deficiencies\" in the government's work had led to \"substantial controversies and disputes in society, causing disappointment and grief among the people.\"\n",
      "Full statement from a government spokesman:\n",
      "Over the past two Sundays, a large number of people have expressed their views during public processions. The Government understands that these views have been made out of love and care for Hong Kong.\n",
      "The Chief Executive clearly heard the views expressed in a peaceful and rational manner. She acknowledged that this embodied the spirit of Hong Kong as a civilised, free, open and pluralistic society that values mutual respect, harmony and diversity. The Government also respects and treasures these core values of Hong Kong.\n",
      "Having regard to the strong and different views in society, the Government has suspended the legislative amendment exercise at the full Legislative Council with a view to restoring calmness in society as soon as possible and avoiding any injuries to any persons. The Government reiterated that there is no timetable for restarting the process.\n",
      "The Chief Executive admitted that the deficiencies in the Government's work had led to substantial controversies and disputes in society, causing disappointment and grief among the people. The Chief Executive apologised to the people of Hong Kong for this and pledged to adopt a most sincere and humble attitude to accept criticisms and make improvements in serving the public.\n",

      "share link Hong Kong extradition law: What happens next? From all available accounts, it appears that the bill was an initiative of Lam's government -- as she has claimed all along -- rather than an order from on high.\n",
      "Lam and her ministers appear to have seen in a gruesome Taiwan murder case a way to win an easy public relations victory by extraditing a wanted killer to face justice, and a way to close loopholes and extend the central government's powers to go after fugitives, especially former Chinese officials, in Hong Kong.\n",
      "They do not, however, seem to have expected the overwhelmingly negative response to the bill and the deep, widespread distrust for the Chinese legal system. Pro-democracy activists, NGOs and business groups came together in calling for the bill's withdrawal, and it also served to unify the previously fractured political opposition.\n",
      "Protests this month -- with the June 9 march the largest since Hong Kong was handed over to Chinese control, and Wednesday's protests among some of the most violent scenes ever seen in the city -- left Lam unwilling to push forward with a bill so clearly unpopular and potentially dangerous.\n",
      "However, while the climbdown is certainly embarrassing to both the Hong Kong and Beijing governments, it only maintains the status quo, as did a mass movement against an anti-sedition law in 2003, previously the largest protests Hong Kong had seen under Chinese rule.\n",
      "Hong Kong residents have proven more willing to come to the streets to fight back against a loss of political freedoms than to push for extra ones, and both the local and central governments appear to have a greater degree of flexibility or patience on these issues as well.\n",
      "The situation in 2014, when demands for the direct election of the chief executive spiraled into the Umbrella Movement, was very different. Those protests did not attract such a broad swath of society, and they were also greeted with a much more forceful reaction by Beijing, and a subsequent crackdown and numerous prosecutions and disqualifications of lawmakers.\n",

      "Does the bill have a future?\n",
      "While Lam emphasized that the bill has been suspended rather than completely withdrawn, it is likely that the effect will be the same, at least in the near term.\n",
      "As opposition to the bill grew, Taipei said it would not request the murder suspect's extradition from Hong Kong, as it said the bill would put Taiwanese citizens in danger. With this off the table, Lam admitted there was \"less urgency to pass the bill this year.\"\n",
      "Going forward, she said she wanted to focus on \"economic and livelihood\" issues, particularly those such as housing, a consistent major issue in Hong Kong, particularly for young people of the sort out protesting Wednesday.\n",
      "That language is similar to what she has used in the past when discussing whether her government would seek to introduce Article 23, the anti-sedition law which was shelved after mass protests against it in 2003. Lam has said she would only do so were the conditions in society correct, and on Saturday she said she regretted that controversies over the extradition bill had spoiled the \"period of calm\" Hong Kong had enjoyed since she took office in 2017.\n",
      "While the government could reintroduce the bill next year, it is unlikely as 2020 is an election year for the legislative council.\n",
      "The newly reinvigorated and unified pro-democratic camp will be targeting marginal seats in an attempt to wrest back veto power in the legislature, and pro-Beijing lawmakers have already warned that the controversies over the bill could cost them seats.\n",
      "So though some protesters and opposition figures may complain that Lam has only suspended rather than withdrawn the bill, the effect may end up being the same. Hong Kong suspends controversial extradition bill after mass protests They were just the latest in a series of public protests against the bill, which critics fear could be used to extradite residents to mainland China for political or inadvertent business offenses.\n",
      "On June 9, more than 1 million people took to the streets in a peaceful march against the legislation, about one in seven of the city's population -- a potential repeat of that demonstration is planned for this Sunday.\n",
      "Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, which has called on Lam to retract the bill entirely, is calling for the chief executive to resign.\n",
      "Speaking after Lam's news conference, pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo said protests would continue until she steps down.\n",
      "\"If she refuses to withdraw, to scrap this controversial bill altogether, it would mean that we wouldn't retreat. She stays on. We stay on,\" Mo said. \"Carrie Lam has lost all credibility amongst the Hong Kong people. She must step down.\"\n",
      "A spokesman for the Civil Human Rights Front confirmed to CNN that the march would go ahead even if the bill was paused.\n",
      "The Democratic Party said in a statement that the march would start at 2:30 p.m. local time Sunday in Victoria Park. Protesters will wear black and demand the bill be completely withdrawn and Lam step down.\n",
      "One protester died on Saturday after falling from a building in Hong Kong's Admiralty district, where he was holding a banner opposing the extradition bill, a police spokeswoman told CNN.\n",
      "'Deep regret'\n",
      "Addressing the media, Saturday, Lam blamed herself for failure to communicate effectively to the public. She said the original driving force of the bill was a murder case in Taiwan, in which the alleged perpetrator, a Hong Kong man, fled to the city. That case, Lam said, highlighted \"loopholes\" in the current law with regards to Greater China.\n",
      "\"As a responsible government we needed to find a solution to deal with this murder case (and) give justice to the family,\" Lam said.\n",
      "However, Taipei said earlier this month it would not seek the man's extradition based on the bill, which it said put Taiwanese citizens at risk, removing any urgency for Hong Kong lawmakers to change the law.\n",
      "While she said the \"original purpose of the bill is correct in my mind,\" Lam added that \"our communication has not been adequate.\"\n",
      "\"I feel deep sorrow and regret that the deficiencies in my work and other factors has stirred up deep dissatisfaction and controversies in society,\" Lam said, adding that she and her team would \"adopt the most sincere and humble attitude\" in future.\n",
      "The climbdown over the bill will raise questions over Lam's future. Before she became chief executive in 2017, Lam said she would resign \"if mainstream opinion makes me no longer able to continue the job.\"\n",
      "Legal concerns\n",
      "Although Hong Kong is part of China, it has a different legal system -- a concept known as \"one country, two systems.\"\n",
      "The return of Hong Kong's umbrella movement\n",
      "Pro-democracy figures said that the bill, championed by the pro-Beijing Lam government, would lead to the erosion of civil rights in Hong Kong, including freedom of speech and rule of law.\n",
      "\"We are afraid that we will become a mainland city,\" lawmaker Fernando Cheung said Thursday. \"We would no longer have rule of law, our own autonomy.\"\n",
      "Throughout the debate Lam has maintained that the bill is necessary to ensure that Hong Kong does not become a sanctuary for fugitives running from justice in mainland China.\n",

Why Nintendo, Google and others may want to move some manufacturing out of China Video game consoles are typically a low-margin business, meaning that tariffs on consoles could be a real problem for Nintendo's ability to turn a profit. And Nintendo has been counting on the Switch console to drive big sales.\n",
      "A spokesperson for Nintendo did not confirm or deny that it would be shifting manufacturing away from China.\n",
      "\"Most of the components that make up the Nintendo Switch console are manufactured in China,\" the spokesperson said. \"To help keep costs down for consumers, it helps logistically to assemble products in close proximity of where those parts are manufactured.\"\n",
      "China opens the door to Nintendo's Switch and Super Mario\n",
      "The Japanese company did, however, say it is closely following the tariff situation, and that it is \"always exploring options\" for where its products are produced.\n",
      "Google (GOOGL) did not respond to a request for comment.\n",
      "Trade war prompts manufacturing moves\n",
      "Beyond Nintendo and Google, companies have been reconsidering their supply chains since the White House launched a trade war with China last year. Last month, the United States hiked import tariffs to 25% from 10% on $200 billion in Chinese goods including electronic equipment and computer products like produce and textiles.\n",
      "Companies that rely on China for production of goods to be sent to the United States are also concerned about other potential Chinese retaliatory measures, such as increased regulations or customs delays. China has ramped up pressure on American companies as trade tensions escalate.\n",
      "After the United States hit Huawei with an export ban on May 15, effectively barring American companies from doing business with the Chinese smartphone maker, China responded by creating a blacklist of foreign firms. Earlier this month, China fined Ford's main venture in the country for antitrust violations, fueling fears about tit-for-tat punitive actions by the two countries.\n",
      "This uncertainty may be an even more compelling reason to move manufacturing than tariffs, said New York University Stern Business School professor Joseph Foudy.\n",
      "\"If we knew China was facing a 15% to 20% tariff, some companies might just chalk that up to a business expense and stay,\" Foudy said. \"It's the uncertainty that drives you to look abroad because you can't put a price on that.\"\n",
      "For tech companies in particular, concerns about intellectual property and security have also been points of contention for the US-China relationship and may put pressure on them to diversify their sourcing and manufacturing networks.\n",
      "Diversifying production\n",
      "Much of the production work moving out of China has shifted to countries in Southeast Asia — not to the United States. The manufacturing sector in the region this month experienced its strongest growth rate in nine months, according to the most recent Nikkei-Markit purchasing manufacturers index, thanks in large part to new orders.\n",
      "Rising wages in China have given companies yet another reason to consider moving production to Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam and Thailand where labor is cheaper. The increasing automation of tech manufacturing makes that easier, as companies no longer have to rely so heavily on highly skilled workers to produce their goods.\n",
      "Much of the production of Google motherboards bound for the United States has already moved to Taiwan, according to the Bloomberg report. Over the past year, Google has also invested in its Taiwan engineering and innovation hub, with plans to expand its campus and double the size of its team in New Taipei City, as well as providing artificial intelligence and digital marketing training to local students.\n",

Not only are factories and suppliers centered there but the infrastructure — roads, ports, airports and power grids — remain better than in many of those countries where production has begun to move.\n",
      "Although companies may gradually move some manufacturing or expand their production networks beyond China, Foudy said he doesn't expect the country's dominance as a manufacturing center will experience any major changes.\n",
      "\"China remains the 'total package' of manufacturing,\" Foudy said. \"The efficiency of manufacturing is based on how many suppliers are located nearby, what the quality of roads and ports and infrastructure is like, the quality and consistency of electricity, and the talent pool to draw on. On all of those metrics, China remains number one.\"\n",
      "US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet at the Group of 20 summit at the end of this month. Trump has threatened to place tariffs on another $300 billion of Chinese exports if China's leader does not attend the meeting. If the negotiations don't end well, companies might more seriously consider moving production out of China. Gulf of Oman tankers attacked What we covered here\n",

      "From CNN's Richard Roth\n",
      "The United Nations Security Council today privately discussed the latest oil tanker attacks in the Middle East, but declined to produce any formal reaction.\n",
      "Kuwait’s UN Ambassador Mansour al-Otaibi said his country was pleased the topic was discussed. He said no country produced any evidence that might point the finger at those responsible.\n",
      "The acting US Ambassador Jonathan Cohen, echoed much of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s earlier comments in Washington, blaming Iran for the attack in an attempt to destabilize the region. Cohen repeated his earlier comment to an open council session in the morning calling the attacks \"unacceptable.\"\n",
      "“Iran should meet us with diplomacy, not with terror attacks on ships, infrastructure and diplomatic facilities,” Cohen added.\n",
      "Cohen said he expected further conversations on the blasts in coming days.\n",

      "Here's what Iran has said about the attacks: Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif noted that one of the ships is Japanese owned and that the attack took place as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was visiting Iran. He called the attack \"suspicious\" in a tweet.\n",
      "\"Reported attacks on Japan-related tankers occurred while PM [Shinzo Abe] was meeting with Ayatollah [Khamenei] for extensive and friendly talks. Suspicious doesn't begin to describe what likely transpired this morning,\" Zarif tweeted.\n",

      "What that means: A limpet mine is type of a mine that is attached to side of a hull using magnets.\n",
      "Limpet mines were also suspected d to be used in the May attack on four oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates. The UAE concluded that a \"state actor\" is the most likely culprit and chemical analysis of the debris recovered in May revealed \"it was highly likely that limpet mines' were deployed.\"\n",
      "What happens now: Additional US navy ships are expected to head to the area in the coming hours for security, patrolling, helping mariners get back to port and potentially assist in arranging for tankers to be towed to port, the source said.\n",

      "What the bill could mean: Critics say the bill will leave anyone on Hong Kong soil vulnerable to being grabbed by the Chinese authorities for political reasons or inadvertent business offenses, and it would undermine the city's semi-autonomous legal system.\n",

Protesters were seen wearing helmets, goggles and heavy-duty workman's gloves, and pulling bricks from the sidewalks.\n",

I see it all the time … but when you look at this demonstration, they said it was a million people. That was a million people,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.\n",
      "“That was as big a demonstration as I’ve ever seen, so I hope it all works out for China and for Hong Kong,” he continued.\n",
      "Asked if protesters are sending a message to China with these demonstrations, Trump said, “I don’t know what they’re sending them. That’s a demonstration that they’re having. I understand the reason for the demonstration, but I’m sure they’ll be able to work it out. I hope they’ll be able to work it out with China.\"\n",
      "At least 72 people have been injured in Hong Kong protests over the bill.\n",

      "Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam is standing firm in her support for the proposed extradition bill despite mounting pressure and death threats.\n",
      "A little about Lam: Lam was chosen as the fourth Hong Kong chief executive in 2017 by a tiny election committee, becoming the city's first female leader. Following the election, however, protestors argued the decision saying it was a \"selection rather than an election.\"\n",
      "Why she supports the bill: Now, amid more turmoil, Lam admits that the new bill is controversial, but said safeguards have been added to the bill to protect human rights. These comments have done nothing to quell opposition.\n",
      "Lam said the bill is needed to plug legal loopholes and prevent Hong Kong from becoming a haven for fugitives. Critics of the bill fear it will allow China to extradite to the mainland to face trial. The bill is expected to get a final vote as early as next Thursday.\n",
      "Lam addressed citizens in a pre-recorded address Wednesday, where she \"condemned\" the actions of protesters and defended the actions of the police.\n",
      "\"These are no longer peaceful demonstrations. They are planned and intentional riots.\" Lam said, adding that \"They have done dangerous and fatal actions, such as, setting things on fire, using sharp metal sticks and throwing bricks to attacking the police.\n",
      "Lam and the Hong Kong government had not acknowledged the divided opinion of amendments to the extradition bill until today. But, Lam did say she understood \"the bill has aroused strong opinions from both sides.\"\n",

      "A police officer fires tear gas during clashes with protesters in Hong Kong on Wednesday. PHILIP FONG/AFP/Getty Images\n",
      "Amnesty International said police's use of forces against protesters in Hong Kong is \"a violation of international law,\" adding that officers have \"taken advantage of the violent acts of a small minority as a pretext to use excessive force against the vast majority.\"\n",
      "Earlier today, police used tear gas and rubber bullets to push back against protesters rallying against a controversial extradition bill.\n",
      "“The ugly scenes of police using tear gas and pepper spray against overwhelmingly peaceful protesters is a violation of international law. Police have a duty to maintain public order, but in doing so they may use force only when strictly necessary. Hong Kong’s police have today failed to live up to this standard,\" Man-Kei Tam, Director of Amnesty International Hong Kong, said in a statement.\n",
      "The statement continued:\n",
      "“The police have taken advantage of the violent acts of a small minority as a pretext to use excessive force against the vast majority of peaceful protesters.\n",
      "Tear gas and projectiles like rubber bullets are notoriously inaccurate and indiscriminate and can result in serious injury and even death. They should only ever be used in a targeted response to specific acts of violence and never to disperse peaceful protesters.\n",
      "This excessive response from police is fueling tensions and is likely to contribute to worsening violence, rather than end it. We urge the Hong Kong police not to repeat such abuses against peaceful protesters, and instead ensure people can legitimately exercise their rights.

Companies like mine will pay the price To be fair to President Trump, a reckoning with China over its trade practices, including allegedly stealing trade secrets and forced technology sharing, has been a long time coming, and, if not under Trump, would ultimately have come to a head under a future administration.\n",
      "Reducing America's overreliance on Chinese imports will be healthy in the long run.

But it will be painful for American companies and consumers in the near term.\n",

      "Diversification is already happening, according to a new report from New York Federal Reserve economists. An 8% year-on-year growth rate in Chinese imports in October flipped to an 18% decline in March — before Trump hiked the tariff rate to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese goods in early May. China's export orders were down in May compared to the previous month, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics.\n",
      "China's Southeast Asia neighbors are mainly picking up the slack and reaping the benefits. According to recent Census Bureau data, US imports from Taiwan rose to 22% in the first four months of 2019, while imports from Vietnam are up 38%. First-quarter imports from South Korea meanwhile rose by 17%.\n",
      "At Canary, we plan to operate as if the tariffs on Chinese goods are here to stay. China's government recently released a white paper on the trade standoff that makes it clear Beijing is not giving in to US demands anytime soon.\n",
      "We have moved much of our manufacturing to Vietnam, India, Malaysia and South Korea. We still depend on China for a significant portion of the wellheads and other steel products used in the oilfields, but it's on the decline. Our goal is for non-Chinese sources to account for 25% of our international purchases within the year, up from our previous target of 10%.\n",
      "Like other US companies, we recognize that doing business with these rival suppliers can be more expensive than with our traditional Chinese partners. But over time, with markets braced for a protracted US-China trade war, that may not be the case as manufacturers in nations that are not in Trump's crosshairs expand their capabilities. For now, the smart move is to build strong business relationships in countries that Washington has far fewer gripes with than Beijing. More than 1 million protest in Hong Kong, organizers say, over Chinese extradition law The government says the bill is designed to plug loopholes in current law by allowing Hong Kong to decide on a case-by-case basis whether or not to send fugitives to territories where it doesn't have formal extradition deals -- such as Taiwan, Macau and mainland China. Lawmakers have said the guarantee of a fair trial will not be written into the bill.\n",

Organizers said more than 180,000 people joined a vigil in the city's Victoria Park on Tuesday, the largest such event since the 25th anniversary in 2014, which came in the politically fraught run-up to the Umbrella protests.\n",
      "Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the number of people who participated in protests in Hong Kong on Sunday. The Civil Human Rights Front estimates there were 1.03 million protesters. Taiwan used to be home to a huge number of bears.

      "Hwang, associate professor and director of the Institute of Wildlife Conservation at Taiwan's National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, is likely the world's foremost expert on this species.\n",
      "But when she first started to study the huge mammals as part of her PhD in 1996, she says her friends and acquaintances reacted with shock.\n",
      "\"They'd say, 'Do we have bears in Taiwan? We never had bears. Do we still have bears?'\" she recalls.\n",

      "Meanwhile, the island's now-defunct V Air Airline took its name from the distinctive white V shape on the black bear's chest.\n",
      "But despite an increased profile, these animals are still in deep trouble, says Hwang. Classified as \"endangered\" by the Taiwan government, the species is being pushed to the brink of extinction by illegal hunting and land clearing.\n",
      "Worse still, the relative rarity of these bears, combined with their dislike of humans, makes it almost impossible to know how many are left.\n",
      "Hwang estimates there are between just 200 and 600 black bears over the entire island.\n",

      "Ben Westcott/CNN\n",
      "Even during Japanese occupation of the island in the early 20th century there were reports of bears being found as low as 100 meters above sea level. Now, Hwang says, they almost entirely live above 1,000 meters.\n",
      "\"At lower elevations, theoretically it would be good habitat, but (they're driven higher) because of all the human disturbances -- mining, recreation, a lot of people activity,\" she says.\n",
      "The bears are primarily omnivorous, with their diet consisting mainly of fruits, nuts and berries. They scrounge over a massive habitat measuring hundreds of square kilometers. Unlike other large bears, they don't hibernate.\n",

      "The entire species is marked as \"vulnerable\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, but Hwang says it hasn't attracted as much attention as other more eye-catching animals, such as pandas or Asian elephants.\n",
      "In fact, the lack of interest to protect the bears that she faced when she started working with them made her furious.\n",
      "\"It is a shame for Taiwanese people,\" says Hwang. \"I feel ashamed, how come they're endangered and they're still treated this way.\"\n",
      "Hunted for meat and medicine\n",
      "While habitat loss has been hard on the bears, the biggest threat to Taiwan's largest mammal is illegal hunting.\n",
      "Over recent decades, there's been a growing, lucrative trade in bear parts -- bear meat for the black market and bones, gallbladders and paws for traditional Chinese medicine.\n",
      "In the past there were strict taboos among indigenous Taiwanese about hunting bears. If you killed one, Hwang says, some tribes even isolated you out of fear you would bring bad luck back to the village.\n",
      "The dense, mountainous forests in eastern Taiwan make up a large part of the bears' native habitat.\n",
      "Ben Westcott/CNN\n",
      "But now, a black bear corpse can be worth as much as $5,000 to a hunter. Studies around Yushan National Park prior to the 1980s found 22% of the area's bears were killed for their meat and body parts. By the 1990s, this had soared to 59%.\n",
      "Hwang says the solution lies in education. If the market for bear parts and meat can be ended by raising consumer awareness, the animals can be saved.\n",
      "\"If there is no market demand, I believe this will lead to less bear killing. This surely will help,\" she says.\n",
      "A sign in Taiwan's Dasyueshan National Park warns hikers and tourists to watch out for bears.\n",
      "Ben Westcott/CNN\n",
      "Another problem is that, due to bears' large feeding grounds, they regularly stray outside of the protected forests and into the wilds where they are vulnerable.\n",
      "Displaying the GPS data of one adult male on her laptop, Hwang shows us his path over the course of months.\n",
      "\"That's the protected forest,\" she says, pointing to a small square covering just a fraction of his path.\n",
      "Still, Hwang says there doesn't need to be more protected areas across the island, just better enforcement against illegal hunting.\n",
      "\"If all the suitable habitat allowed bears to survive, the current capacity for the whole island is able to have 5,000 to 10,000 individuals,\" she says. Instead, there are just hundreds.\n",
      "'More precious than pandas'\n",
      "The only place anyone is likely to see a black bear these days is behind wire and glass at the Taipei Zoo.\n",
      "On a sunny Saturday, tourists from the island and mainland China cluster around the window of the Formosan black bear enclosure.\n",
      "\"He's coming. He's so cute,\" one tourist says in Mandarin as the huge shaggy bear ambles through its cage.\n",
      "Tsai Chien-Chuan, 40-year-old father of two, brought his daughters to the enclosure. He says people need to be educated about how important the bears are to Taiwan.\n",
      "\"They are more precious than pandas,\" says Tsai. \"They are very important with a smaller population. If we don't protect them, they may go extinct.\"\n",
      "A Formosan black bear strolls through his enclosure at the Taipei Zoo.\n",
      "Ben Westcott/CNN\n",
      "Hwang is hopeful for the future of the bears and says she's been encouraged by the growing island-wide awareness of the animal's plight.\n",
      "She now has about 25 volunteers working with her group, setting up camera traps high in the mountains to help track the bears' movements.\n",
      "Up in the mountains near Dasyueshan, there is first-hand evidence of hope for the bears.\n",
      "Using a GPS tracker, linked to a collar, Hwang and her team track down a female bear who has been only showing small signs of movement for months.\n",

      "Russia's geopolitical views align with those of China on many international and regional issues, Putin added.\n",

      "But at the end of the day, both Kirby and Schuster said that Friday's incident was primarily about sending a message to the US.\n",
      "\"Putin clearly has ordered the Russian Navy to pressure the USN whenever opportunities exist. It may possibly be a show of political support for China while Xi is in Moscow, but more likely to signal that Russia is willing to challenge the US dominance on the world stage and at sea,\" Schuster said.\n",

      "Earlier this year, Foster participated in a research project in Hong Kong. Investigators questioned 220 traders about the origin of their seahorse stocks during 2016 and 2017 and found that an estimated 95% were imported from countries with export bans. The traders revealed that Thailand is the number one supplier of Hong Kong's Chinese medicine shops -- despite that country officially suspending exports in January 2016.\n",
      "Small and non-perishable, dried seahorses are easily smuggled across borders, sometimes in mixed consignments with other dried seafood. Several of the traders in Foster's project admitted to carrying them in to Hong Kong in suitcases. With the trade now operating in the shadows, \"it's a lot harder for us to monitor, track and manage it,\" said Foster.\n",

      "The Chinese medicine shops in Sheung Wan are not breaking the law in selling seahorses. A spokesperson for the Hong Kong government's Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said that CITES measures for seahorses are designed to control import and export, but Hong Kong law does not ban trade within the territory.\n",
      "The AFCD has been trying to stop the illegal imports. In 2018, Hong Kong authorities seized 45 shipments of incoming dried seahorses weighing a total of 470 kilograms -- approximately 175,000 seahorses. The heaviest penalty handed to a smuggler was a four-month prison sentence, said the spokesperson.\n",
      "Caught in the net\n",
      "The traditional Chinese medicine market might be fueling demand for seahorses, but if the trade was stopped it would not save them, said Foster. That's because the underlying problem isn't Chinese medicine -- \"it's the fishing industry,\" she said.\n",
      "By dragging a large net between them, these Thai pair trawlers catch more fish than two boats operating independently.\n",

      "Foster explained that as relatively rare animals, seahorses are not usually targeted by fishing boats. However, when indiscriminate fishing gear is used, they get scooped up in the nets along with everything else.\n",
      "Trawl nets -- large nets that are dragged along the seabed, catching everything in their path -- are the worst offenders. According to Project Seahorse, trawlers drag an area of seabed twice the size of the continental United States, every year.\n",
      "Trawl fishing is widespread in Africa, Latin America, east Asia and southeast Asia, said Foster, and southeast Asia is a hotspot for seahorses.\n",

      "As a valuable item, seahorses are usually retrieved from fishing nets and sold.\n",
      "Even if the trade disappeared, seahorses would still be caught in the nets, said Foster -- which would almost certainly kill them. \"Either way, they would be dying,\" she added.\n",
      "Foster said the only way to save seahorses is to better manage fisheries -- reducing the size of fishing fleets, closing large areas of ocean to trawlers and making greater efforts to keep trawlers out of existing exclusion zones.\n",
      "CNN contacted Thailand's Department of Fisheries for their view on seahorse exports and fisheries regulation but had not received a reply at the time of publication.\n",
      "Foster would also like to see trade bans properly enforced with more rigorous checking of dried seafood shipments.\n",
      "\"Without greater political will, it won't be possible to stamp out the problem,\" she said, adding that she fears that seahorses will be wiped out in some parts of the world. US imports from Vietnam and other countries rise amid China trade war The President has repeatedly claimed that his tariffs will prompt manufacturers to bring production back to the US, a core campaign promise.\n",
      "\"The higher the Tariffs go, the higher the number of companies that will move back to the USA!,\" he tweeted this week.\n",
      "Yet he's also acknowledged that his trade wars are driving manufacturing elsewhere -- which dings China but doesn't do much for American consumers.\n",
      "\"Also, the Tariffs can be completely avoided if you buy from a non-Tariffed Country, or you buy the product inside the USA (the best idea). That's Zero Tariffs. Many Tariffed companies will be leaving China for Vietnam and other such countries in Asia. That's why China wants to make a deal so badly!\" Trump tweeted last month.\n",
      "Many US importers, including those that sell hats, footwear and other apparel, rely heavily on China for those goods and component pieces. In some cases, the US doesn't have the factories to produce what's needed. Plus, wages are higher and the US labor market is tight.\n",
      "\"There is a litany of countries that footwear companies will consider before coming to the United States,\" said Matt Priest, president and CEO of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, adding, \"The United States is really not an option.\"\n",
      "But other countries are. Footwear companies will likely first look to shift production to Vietnam, where some shoe manufacturing already exists and it's easy to bring Chinese materials across the border, Priest said.\n",
      "\"I think this notion that everything has to be made here is ignoring the economic facts of the 21st century global supply chain,\" he said.\n",
      "Even before Trump began imposing tariffs, some production was moving out of China because of increasing wages there. US imports from countries like Vietnam and South Korea have been steadily increasing over the past decade.\n",
      "\"The current trade dispute is certainly accelerating that trend,\" said Russell Price, the chief economist at Ameriprise Financial.\n",
      "Trump has also inked a new trade deal with South Korea, opening up its market to US autos.\n",
      "While Taiwan and South Korea are more focused on high-tech items like smartphones and semiconductors, places like Vietnam still offer competitive wages -- making it an attractive place to make apparel and shoes. Mad Cow Disease Fast Facts Both mad cow disease and vCJD are fatal.\n",

      "Tuesday will be a major test of that system, which activists have spent years attempting to get past by using coded phrases such as \"May 35\" or \"that year.\" But it's a test that it will likely pass with ease.\n",

      "In the lead-up to June 4, internet users in China complained about difficulties accessing virtual private networks, a common method of bypassing the firewall, while posts on Chinese social media have been restricted or deleted as companies ramp up censorship during this sensitive period.\n",
      "June 4 has been nicknamed \"internet maintenance day\" for the number of websites that go offline around the anniversary, their owners deciding that being dark is safer than accidentally publishing something which could provoke the ire of the authorities.\n",
      "On Tuesday, CNN's website was blocked by the Great Firewall. While the move is not unprecedented, CNN was available to users in China ahead of the June 4 anniversary, as confirmed by GreatFire.org, an independent site which analyzes internet censorship in China.\n",

      "Other international media organizations, including the New York Times and the BBC, have long been inaccessible to users inside China, according to GreatFire.org.\n",
      "Speaking ahead of the anniversary, Mak Hoi-wah, chairman of the June 4 Museum in Hong Kong, said this type of mass censorship was damaging to the country.\n",
      "\"Without understanding the historical facts, we will not be able to move on,\" Mak said. \"The Chinese government is trying to suppress it because they don't want their wrong deeds be remembered by the people.\" China won't be bullied by US, defense minister says at Shangri-La Dialogue Wei cited Abraham Lincoln fighting to keep the US united during the Civil War, adding: \"Not a single country in the world would tolerate secession. The US is indivisible and so is China.\"\n",
      "Wei spoke at the conference a day after acting US Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, who challenged Beijing to adhere to a \"rules-based order\" so it could fully gain the trust of the international community.\n",
      "But Wei said China was just taking measures to ensure prosperity and a better life for all involved.\n",
      "\"China has never provoked a war or conflict, taken land or invaded another country,\" said Wei, the highest-ranking Chinese official to attend Asia's top defense summit in eight years. \"China has never preyed on others. We shall not let others prey on or divide us either.\"\n",

      "Beijing claims almost the entire 1.3 million square mile South China Sea as its sovereign territory and aggressively asserts its stake. US military officials, meanwhile, have vowed to continue enforcing a free and open Indo-Pacific.\n",
      "Wei portrayed the South China Sea situation as largely a stand-off between Washington and Beijing.\n",
      "\"Who is threatening security and stability in the South China Sea?\" he asked, answering countries outside the region \"who come to flex muscles\" who would then \"walk away and leave a mess behind.\"\n",
      "Those countries forced China to build up military facilities on the disputed islands, Wei said.\n",
      "\"In the face of heavily armed ships and military aircraft, how can we not build defense facilities,\" he said.\n",
      "Wei defended China's detention of hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs in Xinjiang province for economic and security reasons.\n",
      "\"The policy of China in Xinjiang is absolutely right. Because over the past more than two years there is no single terrorist attack in Xinjiang. The living standard of the local people has improved,\" he said\n",
      "Wei also blamed Washington for the ongoing trade war.\n",
      "\"As for the recent trade friction started by the US, if the US wants to talk we will keep the door open. If they want to fight, we will fight until the end,\" he said.\n",
      "\"Bully us? No way,\" he added.\n",
      "CNN's Mark Phillips contributed to this report. Rival South China Sea visions in spotlight as Washington, Beijing front Shangri-La Dialogue The Chinese Type 52D guided missile destroyer Guiyang participates in a naval parade on April 23, 2019.\n",

      "William Choong, senior fellow at the Shangri-La Dialogue, said in a tweet Tuesday that the presence of both Wei and Shanahan would set up \"a clash of two visions — the US/Japan-led 'free and open' Indo-Pacific and China's 'Asia for Asians.'\"\n",
      "Analyst Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center, told CNN: \"Chinese leaders now recognize the value of multilateral defense venues and want to deny the US a monopoly of great power influence.\"\n",
      "US intentions for the region have already been telegraphed strongly.\n",
      "The Pentagon has stepped up freedom-of-navigation operations to as often as weekly. And the commander of the US Pacific Air Forces said this month that Air Force jets were flying in and around the South China Sea almost daily.\n",
      "Washington has also sent warships through the Taiwan Strait separating China from what it calls its renegade province several times this year.\n",
      "One of Washington's Taiwan Strait operations included a US Coast Guard cutter, which later sailed into the South China Sea — sending the fifth arm of its military and its main maritime law enforcement agency into the Pacific fray.\n",
      "More robust US armament packages also seem to be part of the plan. For bilateral exercises with the Philippines in April, the US loaded the amphibious assault ship USS Wasp with 10 F-35B stealth fighters — four more than it normally carries — and sailed it into the South China Sea.\n",
      "The amphibious assault ship USS Wasp transits the waters of the South China Sea with a large load of F-35 fighters.\n",
      "{\"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"name\": \"The amphibious assault ship USS Wasp transits the waters of the South China Sea with a large load of F-35 fighters.\",\"description\": \"The amphibious assault ship USS Wasp transits the waters of the South China Sea with a large load of F-35 fighters.\",\"url\": \"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190424135941-uss-wasp-f-35s-south-china-sea-large-169.jpg\",}\n",
      "Of course, it's not just the US that's active around the region. Its allies and partners are also involved.\n",
      "France sent a ship through the Taiwan Strait this year, and is showing off its Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier on the sidelines of the conference. In May alone, Japanese, Indian, Philippine and US ships took part in a multilateral South China Sea exercise — while conference host Singapore held live-fire drills with India. A four-ship Australian naval force also visited countries around the region in a three-month trip that ended this week.\n",
      "Meanwhile, US officials have bigger plans for the coming year.\n",
      "In a conference call with reporters this month, US chief of naval operations Adm. John Richardson reiterated plans for the forward deployment of two littoral combat ships — fast, maneuverable warships designed for shallow-water operations — to Singapore this year. The ships would be the US Navy assets stationed closest to the South China Sea.\n",
      "And in March, the commander of US Army forces in the Pacific, Gen. Robert Brown, announced plans to train 10,000 US troops for combat in \"a South China Sea scenario.\" The Philippines and Thailand were mentioned as possible destinations for the troops.\n",
      "The US pressure on Beijing extends back to Washington, where a bipartisan group of senators last week introduced legislation that would impose sanctions on Chinese companies and individuals who help the PLA's South China Sea build-up.\n",

      "\"China has been bully in both the South and East China Seas, encroaching on and intimidating its neighbors. Such aggressive behavior cannot go on unchecked,\" Sen. Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat, said in a statement.\n",
      "For its part, China hasn't backed down at all: launching new warships, touting new weapons, keeping its forces active in the South China Sea — around Taiwan and beyond — and blasting Washington.\n",
      "Beijing says it is the US that endangers peace in the region.\n",
      "After the guided-missile destroyer USS Preble sailed near the Chinese-occupied Scarborough Shoal on May 20, the PLA website said: \"The provocation of the US warship endangered the safety of ships, aircraft and personnel of both sides, undermined China's sovereignty and security, violated the basic norms governing international relations and sabotaged regional peace and stability.\"\n",
      "It attributed the comment to Senior Col. Li Huamin, spokesman for the PLA's Southern Theater Command.\n",
      "Li said Chinese ships and aircraft were sent to identify the US destroyer and warn it to leave Chinese-claimed territory.\n",
      "China has no shortage of ships to conduct such surveillance, with the PLA Navy rapidly expanding.\n",
      "What are China's naval goals? The West can't wait to find out\n",
      "On May 12, it launched two Type-52D destroyers in a single day — the 19th and 20th of what are expected to be 30 ships in that class.\n",
      "A US Defense Department report released in early May said China had Asia's largest navy, with more than 300 ships and submarines.\n",
      "Military analyst Euan Graham, who was aboard an Australian warship during a recent South China Sea operation, said it and other Australian and US ships operating in the region were all closely monitored by the Chinese navy.\n",
      "\"The ubiquity of PLAN (PLA Navy) vessels shadowing other warships in the (South China Sea) suggests that China's surface force has grown big enough to be able to 'close-mark' at will,\" Graham wrote on The Strategist blog.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the PLA Navy has held training exercises with Russia off China's east coast and with Thailand to the south.\n",
      "To the north, Chinese air force jets in April conducted what Taiwan said was their most \"provocative\" mission in years in the Taiwan Strait, crossing the median line between the island and the mainland.\n",

      "On May 10, the US raised tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports from 10% to 25%, after talks between the two countries broke down less than a week earlier.\n",
      "Negotiations have now stalled, with each side blaming the other for the recent setbacks. Speaking in Japan on Monday, US President Donald Trump said he was \"not ready\" to make a deal.\n",
      "The US imports far more from China than China does from the US -- one of the reasons for the trade war. As China runs out of US imports to tariff, it has turned to its rare earth exports as a new potential battleground.\n",
      "China accounted for 80% of all rare earth imports by the US between 2014 and 2017, according to the United States Geological Survey, and are were among the few items not hit by US tariffs.\n",
      "In statements posted on its website Wednesday, a representative of China's powerful National Development and Reform Commission again hinted at the possibility of action on rare earths.\n",
      "\"What I can tell you is that if anyone wants to use products made of China's rare earth exports to contain China's development, the people of Ganzhou and across China will not be happy with that,\" the official said, referring to a city in Jiangxi province.\n",
      "China's latest trade war card isn't as strong as Beijing thinks\n",
      "On May 20, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited a rare earth factory in Jiangxi province, an unusual personal touch which many analysts and state media saw as a clear message to Washington.\n",
      "\"Will the rare earth become a counter-control weapon against China's unwarranted suppression (by the US)? The answer is not mysterious,\" the People's Daily commentary said. \"In fact, consumer electronics, military equipment and many other products produced in the US are highly dependent on China's rare earth resources\n",
      "An editorial in state media tabloid Global Times Wednesday was headlined: \"US will rue forcing China's hand on rare earths.\"\n",
      "But while rare earths could prove a potential pain point for Washington, they may not be the advantage some in China think.\n",
      "Eugene Gholz, who has advised the US government on rare earths, wrote in a report for the Council on Foreign Relations that China's leverage over the rare earths market peaked in 2010 and even then it had been difficult to exploit in Beijing's favor.\n",
      "Furthermore, the US also maintains stockpiles of many key rare earth materials, not least those used in the defense industry. Louvre workers strike as museum declared world's most popular (CNN) — It's once again been declared the world's most popular museum, but that may not be a good thing for the Louvre in Paris.\n",
      "The museum broke its own record in 2018, welcoming a whopping 10.2 million visitors and claiming the top spot in an index of the world's most-visited museums.\n",
      "But the Louvre's uptick in visitors is proving too much for many of its workers, and strikes by reception and security staff over the number of tourists flooding through its doors have hit opening hours throughout the week.\n",
      "\"The Louvre is suffocating,\" the workers' union said in a statement. \"The public has increased by more than 20% since 2009, (but) the palace has not grown,\" it added. \"Today the situation is untenable.\"\n",
      "The museum was closed on Monday and opened later than advertised on Wednesday, due to a meeting with the disaffected workers. Visitors have queued outside the building throughout the week, and those without bookings have been turned away.\n",
      "But as tensions with its workers rumble on, the museum's bottom line is looking healthy.\n",
      "The Louvre broke its 2012 attendance record last year, marking a dramatic recovery from a sharp downturn in visits in 2017 that was attributed to a general plunge in tourism in Paris.\n",
      "The social media buzz around Beyoncé and Jay Z's music video filmed at the museum may have played into that spike, authors of the 2018 Museum Index say.\n",
      "The report, published by the Themed Entertainment Association (TEA) and the Economics practice at AECOM, also highlights the success of an exhibition of the work of Eugène Delacroix -- the most popular temporary exhibition in the Louvre's history.\n",
      "But while visitor numbers rose at the Louvre, overall attendance was relatively flat among the top 20 museums in the world last year, according to the TEA Museum Index.\n",
      "Attendance grew among the top 20 by just 0.1% from 2017 to 2018. The top museums collectively welcomed 108.1 million visitors last year.\n",
      "The National Museum in China, the world's second most popular museum, drew nearly 8.6 million visitors in 2018, a nearly 7% increase.\n",
      "Rounding out the top five are The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (No. 3); Vatican Museums in Vatican City (No. 4); and the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC (No. 5).\n",

      "Television cameras caught one fan on center court with his hands on his face, shaking in apparent disbelief. Viewers around the world felt the same.\n",
      "\"The crowd went absolutely nuts,\" said Chang. \"I was pumped up because I was just like, 'Hey, let's sneak out this game,' because it was a big difference in being 15-40 or 30-30. From then on it seemed like the tide turned in my favor. I can't explain why it did but for some reason it did.\"\n",

      "\"I'm still 17 years old, he's still No. 1 in the world and I'm like, 'What is he going to say?'\" said Chang. \"I kind of kept my head down and walked to the side and he didn't have any of it. He was bee lining toward me. I was like, 'I can't avoid this now,' because there was this little walkway where it's only maybe 12 steps wide.\n",
      "\"So he walks up straight toward me and I was like, 'How are you doing?' He put his hand out, looked me straight in the eye and shook my hand and goes, 'Michael, incredible job at the French Open. Congratulations.'\n",

      "Thirty years on, Lendl still doesn't harbor any ill will toward Chang and his use of the underarm serve.\n",
      "He joked that he had seen plenty of underarm serves in the 12-and-unders.\n",
      "\"Michael played well, fought hard and deserved to win,\" he told CNN. \"I didn't and still don't view it as a problem. Michael was one of the nicest people of that era and I don't believe he would do anything unfair.\"\n",

      "\"That's why I skipped Roland Garros the following year and spent four weeks in Australia getting ready for the grass-court season.\"\n",
      "Chang never hit another underarm serve in his career, nor was he ever on the receiving end. Lendl did hit some when the returner \"was on the back fence\" but not many.\n",
      "Chang, however, did topple Lendl in their only other best-of-five set clash at the 1991 Grand Slam Cup in Germany on carpet, a surface now virtually extinct in tennis.\n",
      "Nowadays, they both continue to coach. When they chat, it's about golf, their families -- Lendl has five daughters and Chang two -- and the players they work with.\n",
      "\"I've always had the utmost respect for him, not only as a professional but as a person,\" said Chang.

Huawei CEO says China shouldn't punish Apple The US Department of Commerce placed Huawei on a trade blacklist earlier this month, effectively barring it from conducting business with American companies.\n",
      "The ban forced suppliers like Google (GOOGL) and ARM Holdings to cut off ties with the Chinese company. Top carriers in the UK and Japan are also delaying the launch of Huawei smartphones.\n",
      "The US restrictions threaten Huawei's position as the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker and No. 2 smartphone brand.\n",
      "Washington's ban on the Chinese company \"could stir up the smartphone industry by pausing Huawei's positive momentum,\" analysts at Fitch Ratings wrote in a note on Sunday. The ban could also benefit industry leader Samsung as consumers around the world look for alternatives to Huawei smartphones, they added.\n",
      "What did Huawei do to land in such hot water with the US?\n",
      "Huawei and Apple have had vastly different fortunes in Huawei's home market of China.\n",
      "Huawei shipped nearly 30 million phones in China in the quarter ended March, up 41% compared to the same period last year, according to research firm Canalys.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Apple saw its iPhone sales in China drop 30% in the same period. The country remains a key market for Apple. Greater China, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, accounted for nearly 18% of net sales in the quarter ended March.\n",
      "During an earnings call last month, Apple CEO Tim Cook said iPhone sales in China should be boosted by \"improved trade dialogue\" between Beijing and Washington and \"very positive customer response to the pricing actions we've taken in that market.\"\n",
      "Huawei could be the first big casualty of China's clash with America\n",
      "But since then, trade talks between Washington and Beijing broke down, and both sides ratcheted up tensions by slapping more penalties on billions of dollars worth of American and Chinese products.\n",

China is not the source of our economic problems -- corporate greed is China's Qing Dynasty fell in 1911, after which China quickly succumbed to warlords, internal strife and Japan's invasion of China beginning in 1931. The end of World War II was followed by civil war, the creation of the People's Republic of China in 1949 and then the upheavals of Maoism, including millions of deaths from famine in the Great Leap Forward, which ended in the early 1960s, and the mass destabilization of the Cultural Revolution and its aftermath until 1977.\n",

      "China's rapid development on a market basis therefore started only in 1978, when Deng Xiaoping came to power and launched sweeping economic reforms. While China has seen incredible growth in the past four decades, the legacy of more than a century of poverty, instability, invasion and foreign threats still looms large. Chinese leaders would like to get things right this time, and that means they are unwilling to bow to the United States or other Western powers again.\n",
      "China is now the second-largest economy in the world, when GDP is measured at market prices. Yet it is a country still in the process of catching up from poverty. In 1980, according to IMF data, China's GDP per capita was a mere 2.5% of the United States, and by 2018 had reached only 15.3% of the US level. When GDP is measured in purchasing-power-parity terms, by using a common set of \"international prices\" to value GDP in all countries, China's income per capita in 2018 was a bit higher at 28.9% of the United States.\n",
      "China has roughly followed the same development strategy as Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore before it. From an economic standpoint, it is not doing anything particularly unusual for a country that is playing catch up.The constant US refrain that China \"steals\" technologies is highly simplistic.\n",
      "Countries that are lagging behind upgrade their technologies in many ways, through study, imitation, purchases, mergers, foreign investments, extensive use of off-patent knowledge and, yes, copying. And with any fast-changing technologies, there are always running battles over intellectual property. That's true even among US companies today -- this kind of competition is simply a part of the global economic system. Technology leaders know they shouldn't count on keeping their lead through protection, but through continued innovation.\n",

      "The United States relentlessly adopted British technologies in the early 19th century. And when any country wants to close a technology gap, it recruits know-how from abroad. The US ballistic missile program, as it is well known, was built with the help of former Nazi rocket scientists recruited to the United States after World War II.\n",
      "If China were a less populous Asian country, say like South Korea, with a little more than 50 million people, it would simply be hailed by the United States as a great development success story -- which it is. But because it is so big, China refutes America's pretensions to run the world. The United States, after all, is a mere 4.2% of the world's population, less than a fourth of China's. The truth is that neither country is in a position to dominate the world today, as technologies and know-how are spreading more quickly across the globe than ever before.\n",
      "Trade with China provides the United States with low-cost consumer goods and increasingly high-quality products. It also causes job losses in sectors such as manufacturing that compete directly with China. That is how trade works. To accuse China of unfairness in this is wrong -- plenty of American companies have reaped the benefits of manufacturing in China or exporting goods there. And US consumers enjoy higher living standards as a result of China's low-cost goods. The US and China should continue to negotiate and develop improved rules for bilateral and multilateral trade instead of stoking a trade war with one-sided threats and over-the-top accusations.\n",
      "The most basic lesson of trade theory, practice and policy is not to stop trade -- which would lead to falling living standards, economic crisis and conflict. Instead, we should share the benefits of economic growth so that the winners who benefit compensate the losers.\n",
      "Yet under American capitalism, which has long strayed from the cooperative spirit of the New Deal era, today's winners flat-out reject sharing their winnings. As a result of this lack of sharing, American politics are fraught with conflicts over trade. Greed comprehensively dominates Washington policies.\n",
      "The real battle is not with China but with America's own giant companies, many of which are raking in fortunes while failing to pay their own workers decent wages. America's business leaders and the mega-rich push for tax cuts, more monopoly power and offshoring -- anything to make a bigger profit -- while rejecting any policies to make American society fairer.\n",

      "Since he came to power in late 2012, Chinese President Xi Jinping has increasingly stressed the ruling Communist Party's absolute control over all aspects of society, resulting in a push for more rigid moral codes. In a landscape where freedom of speech and protests against the government are rarely tolerated, Human Rights Watch China researcher Maya Wang said LGBTQ activism had been a \"relatively bright spot\" in Chinese civil society.\n",
      "China's young people have been increasingly supporting of same-sex relationships, Wang added, with some draping themselves in the rainbow flag at their graduations or supporting inclusion on university campuses.\n",
      "She warned, however, that harassment and restrictions on their activities had increased in recent years. LGBT-themed books have been restricted in the country's libraries. Last November, an author of same-sex erotic fiction was sent to jail for ten years.\n",
      "Wang said the fickle Chinese government could implement a crackdown on LGBT rights supporters at a moment's notice. \"You have to be very careful being an activist in China,\" she said.\n",

      "A message to the world\n",
      "The Chinese leadership has never shown any indication of support for LGBTQ rights, but a strange thing happened on Sunday after the Taiwanese legislation passed. It tried to take credit for it.\n",
      "\"Local lawmakers in Taiwan, China, have legalized same-sex marriage in a first for Asia,\" tweeted the Communist Party's official newspaper, People's Daily, on Friday, along with a rainbow color-infused animated image that said \"love is love\" underneath.\n",
      "The post was disingenuous given the fact that Taiwan and China have been governed separately for seven decades, although Beijing considers Taiwan a renegade province and part of its territory.\n",
      "var id = '//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js'.replace(/\\s+/g, '');!!document.getElementById(id) || (function makeEmbedScript(d, id) {var js,fjs;js = d.createElement('script');js.id = id;js.charset = 'utf-8';js.setAttribute('async', '');fjs = d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);js.src = '//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';}(document, id));\n",
      "The tweet provoked fury in Taiwan's government, but it wasn't the only LGBTQ-friendly opinion published in English by Chinese state media. Global Times, a state-run tabloid known for its nationalistic rhetoric, posted a video Saturday showcasing and praising gay social life in Beijing.\n",
      "It isn't clear if this celebration of Taiwan's decision in Chinese state media represented real momentum in a change in Beijing's position or if it was just cynical opportunism.\n",
      "Wang said she was skeptical. \"The Chinese government is often quite adaptive to making use of popular incidents and transforming it into issues that bolster their power,\" she said.\n",
      "In the unlikely scenario that the Chinese government did embrace homosexuality, it wouldn't be unprecedented, according to Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the University of London.\n",
      "\"If you go back in history, there were times when same-sex relationships were widely practiced and accepted in China,\" he said. \"After the collapse of the Han Dynasty, and before reunification under the Shu Dynasty, you have several hundred years when it was widely accepted.\"\n",
      "You can't erase them\n",
      "It isn't just China that is playing politics on this issue. Tsang said the ruling could boost Taiwan's reputation internationally among Western nations.\n",
      "For decades, Taipei has been losing an international battle as Beijing forces diplomatic allies to choose between Taiwan and China, leaving the island relatively isolated. Lagging Beijing in economic and political power, Taipei is only formally recognized by 17 countries.\n",
      "The landmark LGBTQ ruling might not be enough to turn that diplomatic tide, Tsang said, it will burnish Taiwan's reputation as a liberal bastion in Asia.\n",
      "There was even hope before the same-sex marriage law was passed in Taiwan that such a move could spark a wave of support for LGBTQ rights across the region -- including in China.\n",
      "But Yang, the Wuhan native, said she didn't believe marriage equality in Taiwan would inspire support for same-sex marriage inside the Chinese government.\n",
      "\"We have a very different political environment here. It's going to be very difficult to achieve it -- my partner and I don't feel very hopeful,\" she said.\n",
      "For LGBTQ rights activist Peng, a better future is still on the horizon for his cause in China.\n",
      "\"I'm seeing more and more gay Chinese come out of the closet and live the lives they want,\" he said.\n",
      "\"You can't erase all these living, breathing human beings no matter how much Chinese civil society is being squeezed. We just need more time.\"\n",
      "The graphic in this story has been updated to correct the legal status of same-sex marriage in Jamaica. Hong Kongers wanted for rioting granted refugee status in Germany Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang would not comment on the case in question, but said that issues in Hong Kong \"are also China's internal affairs.\"\n",
      "\"Other countries don't have the right, nor should they interfere, in such affairs, no matter what made-up excuses they use,\" he said.\n",
      "Wong told the Times that \"if the German government thinks that the Hong Kong judiciary is independent, they would not grant me refugee status. It's because they think that Hong Kong uses the judiciary to persecute Hong Kong people.\"\n",

      "Thousands march in Hong Kong against extradition law 02:58\n",
      "The news comes amid a furious debate in Hong Kong's legislature over a proposed extradition bill which activists fear could be used to send dissidents and critics of Beijing to mainland China. Lawmakers came to blows earlier this month, as the government tried to push the bill through the semi-democratic legislature.\n",
      "Hong Kong officials argue the extradition law is necessary to close loopholes in current legislation that make it difficult to transfer suspects to countries and territories with which the city does not have an extradition treaty.\n",
      "In particular, they have pointed to the case of a man wanted for murder in Taiwan who cannot be extradited under the current law. However, Taipei has since stated that it will not seek his return to the island if the proposed legal change puts Taiwanese in Hong Kong at risk of being extradited to China.\n",
      "Multiple international and local bodies have weighed in against the bill, saying it risks undermining Hong Kong's freedoms and rule of law. Critics point to previous incidents in which critics of Beijing have been snatched in the city and taken across the border, and to the widespread use of politically-motivated prosecutions in China.\n",
      "On Tuesday, Beijing's top official responsible for Hong Kong affairs, Vice Premier Han Zheng, spoke out in support of the extradition bill. He said the central government \"completely supports the work launched by the Hong Kong government, and strongly believes that through the hard work of the government and the rational debate held by different sectors, doubts will surely be cleared and a consensus reached.\"\n",
      "Fled to Germany\n",
      "Wong and Li jumped bail in 2017 and traveled to Germany, where they applied for asylum, according to the Times.\n",
      "Under German law, refugee status can be granted where applicants are able to demonstrate a \"well-founded fear of being persecuted\" on the basis of race, nationality, political opinion, religion or membership of a particular social group.\n",
      "Examples of persecution include \"legal, administrative, police and/or judicial measures which as such are discriminatory, or are applied in a discriminatory manner (and) disproportionate or discriminatory prosecution or punishment.\"\n",
      "Under the \"one country, two systems\" principle adopted when Hong Kong was handed over from British to Chinese rule in 1997, the city became a special administrative region of China but retained its legal and political systems, including freedoms of speech and assembly not enjoyed in mainland China.\n",
      "While it is unclear under what grounds Wong and Li received asylum, independence activists have faced increasing political pressure in Hong Kong since 2016. Last year, the government banned a separatist party for the first time, reiterating its \"zero tolerance on 'Hong Kong independence'.\"\n",
      "Proponents of Hong Kong independence and of greater legal autonomy from Chinese rule have been barred from standing for election, and disqualified from the city's legislature. Inflatable 'Tank Man' appears in Taiwan ahead of Tiananmen Square crackdown anniversary Written by Oscar Holland, CNN\n",
      "An inflatable artwork depicting the infamous \"Tank Man\" incident has appeared in the heart of Taiwan's capital, Taipei, nearly two weeks before the 30th anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown in Beijing.\n",
      "Recreating a widely-known image from China's ill-fated 1989 pro-democracy protests, the provocative sculpture has been installed outside the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, one of Taiwan's most visited tourist attractions.\n",
      "The sculpture is reportedly the work of Taiwanese multimedia artist Shake, whose previous projects have explored history, identity and geopolitics. Her balloon artwork recreates the moment when an unidentified man stood before a row of tanks in a Beijing street following a military crackdown. Estimates of the death toll from the crackdown range from several hundred to thousands. An official death toll has never been released.\n",

      "Outside China, \"Tank Man\" has become one of the 20th century's most iconic images. After the initial standoff, famously captured by American photographer Jeff Widener from the balcony of a nearby hotel, the unknown man was filmed climbing up to the tank's turret and speaking to a soldier inside, before dismounting.\n",
      "Made in Taiwan: From mass manufacturing to high design\n",
      "The image Widener shot for the Associated Press soon spread around the world, and is now the most recognized symbol of the bloody crackdown. It was taken the day after the so-called \"June Fourth Incident,\" in which China's military cleared Tiananmen Square of protesters who had gathered to call for democratic reforms.\n",
      "American photographer Jeff Widener's famous images was captured from the balcony of a nearby hotel. Credit: JEFF WIDENER/AP\n",
      "The incident remains a sensitive topic in China, and the \"Tank Man\" image -- along with recreations and parodies of it -- are regularly subjected to online and media censorship.\n",
      "Taipei's Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, named after the defeated leader who fled to the island after the Communist revolution in 1949, is considered one of the city's top tourist sites, attracting, invariably, visitors from the mainland. According to statistics from Taiwan's Tourism Bureau, almost 2.7 million visitors arrived on the island from China in 2018.\n",

      "Previously, the organization's churches in Africa tended to be run and attended by Africans, he says. But increasingly Bread of Life is seeing Chinese-led congregations forming across the continent, as more Chinese move to Africa and interact with local values.\n",

      "'The Kenyan wedding everyone is talking about'\n",
      "The first time Liang Yongyu met Karen Ngunjiri at the billboard advertising company where they both worked in Nairobi, he told her she would be his wife.\n",
      "Him being Chinese? Not a problem. But him not being a Christian, I thought that was going to be a big issue\n",
      "Karen Ngunjiri\n",
      "The pair dated for 6 months, then hit a roadblock that threatened to scupper his swaggering prediction. Liang, 33, was not a Christian.\n",
      "\"That was a deal breaker for me,\" says Ngunjiri, 29, who spent four years studying Mandarin in Nanning, south-west China. \"Him being Chinese? Not a problem. But him not being a Christian, I thought that was going to be a big issue. How would we bring up our children?\"\n",
      "Liang had lived in Kenya for a \"long time,\" could speak some Swahili and had been \"hearing a lot about Christianity\" from his Kenyan friends, Ngunjiri says. After some soul searching, he said he \"was open to exploring what Christianity had to offer,\" she adds.\n",
      "Liang connected with a church in Nairobi that held services in Cantonese -- the language spoken in his home province of Guangdong, in southern China, and Hong Kong, where the pastors who founded the ministry were from.\n",
      "In December 2018, those Hong Kong pastors married the couple in a Christian ceremony in the shadow of Mount Kenya in front of 200 guests -- \"a small wedding for Kenya,\" jokes Ngunjiri.\n",
      "Weeks later, a video of their wedding went viral on YouTube with the title: \"THE KENYAN WEDDING EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT.\" Ngunjiri still doesn't know who uploaded it, but for months the newlyweds couldn't walk down the street in Nairobi without being recognized. The novelty of a Kenyan woman marrying a Chinese man had got people's attention.\n",

      "\"Some of the comments (online) were horrible,\" she says, of the video that has since been taken down, but at its peak had nearly 300,000 views, according to Ngunjiri. \"Especially from Kenyans. There's this idea that the Chinese are here to steal our jobs or colonize us. So the joke was now they're stealing our women.\"\n",
      "In 2017, China was Kenya's largest trading partner and, in 2014, the country was home to an estimated 40,000 Chinese migrants. But their relations with Kenyans have, at times, been tense.\n",
      "In 2015, a Chinese restaurateur reportedly banned African patrons after 5 p.m., last year a Chinese boss was deported from Kenya after being caught on video calling an employee a \"monkey,\" and local media has claimed that Kenyan workers on the Chinese-built railway have been treated like second-class citizens by their foreign employers.\n",
      "Kenyans are also concerned about how much debt their country owes to China. Last year, in a seeming show of strength against Chinese dominance President Kenyatta Uhuru banned imports of cheap Chinese fish, amid claims it was squeezing out local produce. But his ban was soon reversed: Kenya does not produce enough fish to feed itself.\n",

      "The anti-Chinese commentators on Ngunjiri's wedding video, however, had perhaps missed the point.\n",
      "Rather than Ngunjiri being overpowered by Chinese culture, it was Liang who had changed his faith and agreed to a Christian African wedding with just 20 Chinese guests who didn't include his mother, embracing a new culture 5,300 miles from home.\n",
      "A new door opens\n",
      "An estimated 1 million Chinese have moved to the African continent in the 21st century, according to journalist Howard French's book \"China's Second Continent,\" amid growing trade ties between the two regions. But what is perhaps unique about Kenya's Chinese population, and why it is embracing the country's religious culture, is its diversity. A 2015 study found the Chinese in Kenya are spread \"across every sector in a significant way.\"\n",
      "This makes a difference. Employees of government-owned giants, shipped out to build roads in Uganda or airports in Zimbabwe, for example, are typically bused to and from work and must stay inside their compounds in the evenings and at weekends unless given approval to leave by a manager. But in Nairobi -- a vibrant city home to African tech giant M-Pesa, which revolutionized mobile banking in East Africa -- a younger generation of Chinese are working in the private sector, freer to explore new cultures and belief systems through their personal connections with local people.\n",

      "Annie Hu, 30, began attending church in Kenya; Chinese and Kenyan employees mix at a media company office; the China Center where many Chinese expats have businesses.\n",
      "Among them is Annie Hu, 30, who relocated to Kenya five years ago and works for a Chinese financial technology, or fintech, giant. She says the 9-to-5 \"pole pole\" (meaning \"slowly slowly\" in Swahili) lifestyle here is more attractive than the 9-9-6 grind -- working 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week -- at some of China's biggest technology companies in the country's Silicon Valley city of Shenzhen, where she relocated from.\n",
      "\"Living in a developing country and international city you encounter different nationalities, races and lifestyles,\" Hu says. After frequently traveling for work to the Muslim majority city of Dar es Salaam, in Tanzania, she went to Lebanon and Jordan last year to learn more about Muslim culture. \"It opened a totally new door for me,\" she says. Asked how she felt about China's treatment of Muslims, Hu replies: \"We need more understanding.\"\n",
      "Once we engage with the local community, it's inevitable we are invited to join the church\n",
      "Annie Hu, Nairobi resident\n",
      "Hu's family is Buddhist but in Nairobi she has attended Christian churches, including one led by Hong Kong pastors, as well as a Maasai church. \"Kenyans believe in God more than my Western friends,\" she says. \"Once we engage with the local community it's inevitable we are invited to join the church. These people are very friendly and reliable and they try to build a supportive community for the Chines e.\"\n",
      "Chow from Bread of Life agrees the church is an important social network for newcomers. \"I also think the cultural differences and the hardship the Chinese experience here means they are more open to the gospel,\" he says.\n",
      "For Hu, flirting with various Christian communities hasn't resulted in a full conversion. \"It's brought more different religions into my life ... But I didn't reach a point where I felt I want to become a serious Christian yet. Not yet,\" she adds.\n",
      "The world's biggest Christian nation?\n",
      "It is not only the Chinese in Kenya who are embracing Christianity. Many Chinese students in America, Australia and the UK are returning home Christian, says Ian Johnson, author of \"The Souls of China: The Return of Religion After Mao.\" Their conversion chimes with a broader trend at home: China itself is on track to be the world's biggest Christian nation by 2030, by some estimates.\n",
      "For much of the 20th century, Chinese citizens were taught to worship the founding father of the Communist Party, Mao Zedong, the revolutionary leader who destroyed much of the nation's Buddhist and Taoist religious infrastructure during the Cultural Revolution. \"There used to be 900 temples in Beijing alone,\" says Johnson. \"Now there are 20.\"\n",

      "Mao's death in 1976 left the Chinese searching for a new value system. Christianity seemed fresh and modern to the country's newly urban residents, Johnson says, although more people in China are still Buddhist.\n",
      "By 2017, there were between 93 million and 115 million Christians in China -- around 5% of the country's population -- but fewer than 30 million practice in official churches, according to Purdue University scholar Yang Fenggang. If those estimates pan out, there would now be almost as many Christians in China as there are members of the Communist Party, which had an estimated 90 million members in 2016.\n",
      "That has riled the government. Under President Xi Jinping rhetoric has grown on the need to \"Sinicize\" religions perceived to be Western, despite the fact many Christians in China do not feel \"un-Chinese or foreign,\" says Johnson.\n",
      "The congregation is offered grape juice during Communion at the Bread of Life.\n",

      "Today, only state-sanctioned Christian organizations are legal in China. Overcrowded state churches run as many as 5 services a day and their pastors' wages are paid by the government, says Johnson. The alternatives are so-called house churches which operate illegally but can offer a more personal ministry, with pastors on first-name terms with their congregation.\n",
      "For years, such churches were tolerated in China but recently they have become a target of the authorities and their requests to register with the state are often rejected.\n",
      "In December 2018, one of China's best-known underground ministries, the Early Rain Covenant Church, in Chengdu, was raided. The pastor and his wife were charged with \"inciting subversion,\" which can carry a 15-year prison sentence, and more than 100 worshipers were arrested.\n",
      "An underground church in Kenya\n",
      "Kenya is not a place you'd expect to find an underground church. Christianity is the lifeblood of the nation's politics and societal fabric, and is celebrated in huge, rambunctious services attended by thousands of dancing and singing worshipers.\n",
      "But, in the northern stretches of the sprawling, traffic-choked capital of 4 million people, an underground Chinese house church is exactly what May Li, wife of a Malaysian-Chinese pastor, helps to lead -- illustrating just how far the Communist Party's religious crackdown has traveled. Li and other Chinese Christians in this story did not want to use their real names for fear of being punished by the government when they return to China.\n",
      "The Chinese embassy in Nairobi has already reached out to the leaders of some Chinese Christian groups in the city and asked them to desist, says Li. Her service tries to stay below the radar.\n",
      "It's notable that the three main Christian churches in Nairobi are run by Chinese pastors from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Malaysia -- places outside mainland China where Chinese people enjoy more Christian religious freedom.\n",
      "A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Mofa) in Beijing said it was \"not aware\" of this situation, adding that China does not have \"so-called house churches.\"\n",
      "\"The Chinese government respects its people's religious freedom and protects normal religious activities and legitimate rights of religious organizations, and manages religious issues pertaining to national and public interests in accordance with law,\" the spokesperson said via fax. \"At the same time, we require all religions to obey national laws and carry out activities within the law.\"\n",
      "On Sunday afternoons, Li's underground church meets in a small basement room of a huge Kenyan church. No photography is allowed. No names of attendees can be revealed. No Chinese person here wants to be outed as a Christian.\n",
      "The Bread of Life service is held in a high-rise office tower, which is busy Monday to Friday but empty on Sundays apart from this church.\n",

      "\"These people will one day go back to China,\" says Li, explaining that this congregation is a transient group often working in Kenya for short stints. Most were Christian before they came and, if they belonged to a house church, are aware of some of the risks.\n",
      "Church translator Grace Zhang, from Hubei province, falls into that category. \"Things are very difficult for my church in China right now,\" says Zhang, who did not want her real name used. She became a Christian with her mother in 2002 and relocated to Kenya to proselytize to Chinese abroad, as well as to Kenyans.\n",
      "Despite her work, Zhang hesitates to call herself a missionary -- \"that's a sensitive word,\" she says. Chinese law bans missionary work in China. Instead, Zhang prefers the term \"cultural mediator.\"\n",
      "Many Africans from Uganda, Burundi, Kenya and Sudan also attend the bilingual service, which is delivered in English and Mandarin, hoping to improve their language skills or learn more about China. \"God gave them the burden of loving the Chinese,\" Zhang says.\n",
      "Through their interaction at the church, Zhang helps Africans and Chinese better understand each other. She explains to the Chinese, for example, that Kenyans place a high value on in-depth greetings, meaning that asking about the well-being of multiple family members is a cultural necessity. She warns Africans that many Chinese do not respond well to overly physical greetings.\n",
      "\"We try to learn from both sides,\" she says.\n",
      "China vs God ... going home\n",
      "In Chinese state media, the clampdown on faith goes largely unreported and Christianity is \"virtually invisible,\" says Johnson -- the government doesn't want to \"encourage anyone to think about religion.\"\n",
      "That explains why worshipers at the Bread of Life church in Nairobi are open about sharing their Christianity. This is a more settled congregation. Having found religion abroad and been out of China for several years, in most cases, they often simply do not know the extent of their government's crackdown, says Chow -- although many have a sense the government is not enthusiastic about religion.\n",
      "When members want to repatriate, however, they have to be enlightened of the potential risks.\n",
      "Maggie Wong, 35, a pastor at Bread of Life, says the church tries to prepare them for what they will face and has a network of underground churches to connect them with. \"It's very stressful,\" she says.\n",
      "A Chinese Christian reads a Bible at a church in Nairobi.\n",

      "\"From a spiritual perspective, I think it's not easy for returnees to survive when they go back to their home country if they live overseas,\" says Zhang, from the underground church. \"When they go back we keep in touch with them and even Skype for bible study.\"\n",
      "Some Christians in Kenya, however, who learn of the potential dangers that await them in China say it could be a deterrent from returning.\n",
      "Jimmy Hong Zhen Wu, 53, a trader from Guangdong province, became Christian during the decade he has spent living in Kenya, where his wife has given birth to two daughters now under 8 years old. He travels to China regularly for work and says he is conscious of the double life he would need to lead back home.\n",
      "\"In public, in China we can't speak about our faith,\" says Wu, who did not want his real name used. \"Only with friends and family can we say we are Christian.\"\n",
      "Whether his daughters, who have spent their lives in a proudly Christian society attending church every Sunday, will understand those confines if their family one day heads back to China remains to be seen.\n",

      "He also brushed off concerns about the trade war with the United States, saying that because the company already does a good job of keeping costs low and is selling its coffee at a discount to Starbucks, there should be little impact on its sales and customer base.\n",
      "To that end, Chinese consumers in Beijing told CNN that price is one of Luckin Coffee's biggest selling points.\n",
      "\"It has great value. A Starbucks coffee usually costs around 40 yuan (nearly $6 USD). Here we use coupons a lot. It's usually around 20 with discounts. So value is the first consideration,\" said Terasa Wang, a sales manager.\n",

      "Always a major Pride destination, the Big Apple will become an even bigger global draw this year as the site of the first US-based WorldPride with 50+ events over a span of 30 days, from June 1 to June 30, 2019, dubbed Stonewall50.\n",
      "Organizers expect more than 3 million people will attend the scores of lectures, rallies and parties, both free and ticketed. Following the kick-off Garden Party on June 24 to benefit the LGBT Community Center, a Human Rights Conference will bring together activists, artists, educators, writers, political figures, and other top thinkers on June 24 and 25.\n",
      "Other events include: Pride Island, a two-day music festival on Pier 97 in Hudson River Park with headliner Grace Jones; a \"graphic art, anime, and manga-inspired costume party for all nerdy members of the LGBTQ+ community\" called Cosplay & Pride; the Chelsea Challenge ice hockey tournament; Femme Fatale, the \"official rooftop party for women\"; and four days of Gay & Sober Pride events, including workshops, presentations, meetings, and activities.\n",

      "The Netherlands's own watershed demonstration took place seven years later during a protest organized by the International Lesbian Alliance, which later evolved into an annual event called \"Roze Zaterdag\" (Pink Saturday) that takes place in different Dutch city each year.\n",
      "While Pink Saturday started as a protest march, Pride Amsterdam began as a party celebrating freedom and diversity and promoting the city as a gay destination, says Pride Amsterdam's director Lucien Spee. Only later was the \"emancipatory content\" added to create today's more well-rounded festival.\n",
      "Main events include the July 27 Pride Walk and Pride Park which, following the Walk, turns Vondelpark into an \"Open Air Theater\" with performances, sports, games and a rainbow market selling pride merch and offering information from a variety of organizations, as well as activities for young people. Other Pride programming includes art, theater, film, debate and sports events as well as multiple street parties (find an impressive list of them here) that rage throughout the city on Friday and Saturday nights, creating a festive spirit that some have likened to a \"mini Mardi Gras.\"\n",
      "The grand finale Closing Party will be held from 2 -- 10pm on Sunday in Dam Square, a busy center filled with shops, restaurants and food stalls. The square is home to the grand 17th century Koninklijk Palace, former residence of the Dutch Royal family; Madame Tussauds's famous wax museum; and Nieuwe Kerk (New Church), now used as an exhibit space for important art shows.\n",
      "But before that denouement, the highlight of Pride Amsterdam is, of course, the world-famous Canal Parade, held this year from 12:30 -- 5pm on August 3, featuring parade floats that actually float. This year's parade will include 80 boats, says Spee, all supporting the main message of the event: \"Be who you are. Love who you want.\"\n",
      "Salvato says it's not easy to get onto an official float, but some insist the best way to join in the fun is to stake out a spot along the canals early, and come prepared with food, drink and a bunch of friends. You could easily spend four hours or more taking in the colorful, high-energy spectacle of costumes, synchronized dances and overall pageantry that draws an international crowd of more than half a million people of all ages, genders and sexualities.\n",

      "Throughout the fest, visitors can take advantage of Pride guided tours through the city's most prominent museums to gain a glimpse of Vienna's rich history, which includes numerous gay and lesbian emperors, warlords, princesses and composers.\n",
      "Or take a gay city tour with stops at the Vienna Opera, the Imperial Palace, Providentia Fountain, Neuer Markt and the Park of Belvedere Palace—the summer residence of one of the most prominent gay people in Austrian history: Prince Eugene of Savoy (1663--1736).\n",

Nearly 100,000 visitors are expected.\n",

      "If you visit for Pride, stay to see the rest of the city. One of Prague's most spectacular attractions is the Old Town Square (Staromestské námestí), established in the 12th century as the city's original marketplace where you can see the stunning 15th century Astronomical Clock, the baroque Church of St Nicholas, the rococo Kinský Palace and the gothic Stone Bell House.\n",

      "Canada and the Philippines are feeling some kind of way about each other right now. The two countries are having a diplomatic squabble -- over trash. And not just any old trash, mind you. They're fighting about 6-year-old trash. The tensions have gotten so bad that the Philippines has recalled its ambassador to Canada. This trash tiff started in 2013 when more than 100 containers of material from Canada arrived in the Port of Manila. It was supposed to be recyclable plastic; it turned out to be nonrecyclable plastic, household waste and diapers. Now Canada is accused of violating an international treaty governing the transport of hazardous waste. The Philippines wants the garbage gone, and President Rodrigo Duterte has threatened to ship it all back and \"throw them into the shores or beach of Canada.\"\n",

Trump's trade war shows how China has lost all its friends in Washington \"There is a broad hawkishness on China that straddles left, right, and center,\" said Patrick Lozada, China director at the Washington-based strategic advisory firm Albright Stonebridge Group (ASG). \"The problem with this consensus is that in the absence of a credible counter-argument, the actual facts on the ground can sometimes be lost as people compete to see who can be more hawkish.\"\n",

      "Trade war\n",
      "When Trump introduced new tariffs on Chinese products last year, there were complaints from top Democrats -- that he didn't go far enough.\n",
      "\"The United States must take strong, smart and strategic action against China's brazenly unfair trade policies,\" Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said at the time. \"Yet, today's announcement is merely a start, and the Trump Administration must do much more to fight for American workers and products.\"\n",
      "Even today, as the expansion of those tariffs have started to bite both consumers and manufacturers at home, offering a tantalizing attack line for Democrats in 2020, criticisms from those in the party's leadership are of Trump's execution, not his target.\n",
      "\"We should not be having a multifront war on tariffs,\" Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer said this week. \"I would focus everything on China. And get the Europeans, Canadians and Mexicans to be on our side and focus on China. Because they are the great danger.\"\n",
      "On Trump's side of the aisle, voices critical of his deal have been outweighed by Republicans wanting to take an even harder line on China -- even as many sought to rein him in on expanding tariffs against European allies.\n",
      "\"The President is right to hold China's feet the fire on this,\" Senator John Barrasso told CNN on Wednesday. \"They wouldn't be negotiating at all if it weren't for what the President has done ... The President has his own timeline. I support what he is doing.\"\n",

      "\"I'm hard-pressed to think of another consensus in American foreign policy that's moved as far and as fast as the US consensus on China,\" Richard Hass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, a New York-based think tank, said in February.\n",
      "\"People have grown weary of Chinese trade practices, of technology theft. But it's also a reflection of what's going inside China ... with the treatment of the Uyghurs, the abolition of (term) limits by the president. And it's also because of strategic concerns such as the South China Sea and what China has done there.\"\n",
      "Lozada, the ASG analyst, said that \"Beijing has failed to grasp the changing nature of US politics and the growing concerns about the slow pace of reform in China. When President Trump took office, they regarded him as a transactional businessman without taking serious his remarks about trade on the campaign trail and growing skepticism of China's role in the global economy at all levels.\"\n",
      "Bipartisan China hawkishness isn't only hurting Beijing on trade either.\n",
      "Human rights, often an overlooked topic in relations with Beijing, have come back to the fore, along with calls for punitive sanctions that would further weaken China's economy in the middle of a trade war.\n",
      "This week, leading Hong Kong democrats were on Capitol Hill to testify before the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), a bipartisan panel which issues an annual report on the state of human rights in China and has grown in influence under the Trump administration.\n",
      "In his opening remarks, CECC chair James McGovern, a Democratic congressman, said he believed \"it is time for the United States to consider new and innovative policies to support the people of Hong Kong.\"\n",
      "McGovern and others have suggested Washington review the US-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, under which it treats the city as a separate customs territory to the rest of China, so long as Hong Kong remains \"sufficiently autonomous.\" Suspending Hong Kong's special status could devastate the city's economy and also hit Beijing hard, given its reliance on Hong Kong's financial sector.\n",
      "CECC members, including Republican Senator Marco Rubio, have called for China to be sanctioned under the Magnitsky Acts for its oppression of the Uyghur minority in Xinjiang, where hundreds of thousands if not millions of mostly Muslim people have been detained in \"re-education camps.\"\n",
      "The Magnitsky Acts, which impose visa sanctions and asset freezes on alleged human rights violators, were originally introduced to go after Russia and have since been expanded to target officials from Myanmar, Saudi Arabia, and other countries.\n",
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers, led by Rubio, have called for China to be added to the list. Doing so would strike a major blow against the finances and freedom to travel of top Chinese officials, but would also torpedo any hopes of improving relations with Beijing.\n",

      "Dangers of further split\n",
      "Despite widespread skepticism and hostility towards China in Washington today, better bilateral relations in the past paid off for both countries. China's economy exploded after it entered the WTO in 2000, and the US has long enjoyed the benefits of cheap Chinese manufacturing.\n",
      "The chances of relations reaching a breaking point and turning into an open conflict are slight, but very real. US military leaders have expressed alarm over China's moves in the South China Sea and towards Taiwan, as Washington has ramped up its own military engagement in the region, something Beijing regards as a provocation.\n",
      "Taiwan has bought weapons from the US and lobbied for even greater support from Washington. The island's de facto independence from China has always been guaranteed to some extent by a belief that the US may come to its aid in a military conflict with Beijing.\n",
      "While relations are unlikely to sour to the point of actual conflict there is a risk of a new Cold War developing, with other nations forced to choose sides.\n",
      "That could create a bloc allied against Washington, something that it has not faced since the height of the original Cold War. As commentator Henry Luce wrote in December, better relations between Washington and Beijing under Nixon helped exacerbate the Sino-Soviet split, one factor which resulted in the USSR's eventual collapse.\n",
      "\"Mr Trump is triggering a 'reverse Nixon',\" Luce wrote. \"Decades of convergence is going into reverse. It is happening at a speed that is taking even Americans by surprise.\"\n",
      "That was five months ago, and things have only sped up since then. What are China's naval goals? The West can't wait to find out But despite its resources, China and the PLAN face challenges and shortfalls that preclude it from being the threat these advances might suggest.\n",
      "Pentagon says China's military using espionage to steal secrets\n",
      "One big problem: China's military branches still don't work that well together, despite a strong push by President Xi Jinping that they do so and recent reforms establishing joint theater commands.\n",
      "The PLA has yet to demonstrate full service integration in its exercises, suggesting much work remains to be done. Joint exercises continue to be small-scale, and the services' roles in them remain separated either physically or chronologically.\n",
      "This means gaps remain in multi-service operations, particularly in operations beyond the First Island Chain or \"Far Seas.\"\n",
      "China enjoys surveillance superiority over the waters near its coast (the Near Seas) but not in the Far Seas. Its lack of sea-based air power and overseas bases to provide land-based air support limits the PLAN's capacity to project power ashore by other than land-attack cruise missiles or unmanned systems.\n",
      "While the PLAN has significantly increased its overseas operations since it started anti-piracy operations 11 years ago, it has yet to demonstrate the capability to protect its sea lines of communications through the Indian Ocean, through which 70% of China's energy requirements and over 80% of its trade must pass.\n",
      "China's military is going from strength to strength under Xi Jinping\n",
      "It has a naval support base in Djibouti and access agreements in the region, but the PLAN's logistics train lacks the capacity to support the deployed forces required to counter a major opponent.\n",
      "Nonetheless, China's maritime challenge is very real.\n",
      "It has initiated a massive oceanographic research and survey effort across virtually all the world's oceans. And the PLAN does operate globally, conducting exercises with more than 30 nations and operating in all the world's oceans and four of the seven seas.\n",
      "And China's marine strategy, authored by its Maritime Commerce Ministry, brings numbers to bear that no country can match, by closely integrating China's civic, commercial, diplomatic and naval operations.\n",
      "For example, Chinese companies and merchant shipping constituted the first responders to Mozambique following recent typhoon devastation. The PLAN has a supporting role in that strategy, advancing China's economic and political interests.\n",
      "While regional goals, including dominance of the \"near seas\" -- Taiwan and the South China Sea -- remain the PLAN's main focus, China's leaders are addressing the PLAN's worldwide ambitions and plan to achieve those goals before 2050.\n",
      "New satellite images may reveal China's next aircraft carrier\n",
      "The West's experts and intelligence community must monitor its progress closely, shedding past assumptions when assessing new information to provide decision makers the insights required to anticipate and forestall any aggressive designs that China may harbor.\n",
      "Deterring conflict requires adequate force levels and clear understanding of all the parties' actions and intentions.\n",
      "To this point, the West has done a poor job figuring this out and is now playing catch-up.\n",
      "Capt. Fanell described it as the \"US intelligence community and academia miscalculation of the scope, scale and timing of the PLAN's modernization and its impact on US national security.\"\n",
      "China presently maintains a near global presence on the world's oceans, its fleet is growing rapidly and its intentions seem more assertive than Beijing's official statements profess. If dominating any portion of the \"Far Seas\" is China's goal, waiting for Beijing to achieve it before responding is not an option that assures peace.\n",
      "China is employing an integrated multi-agency approach to expanding its influence in every continent. It has established economic links with countries across the world, and its Belt and Road Initiate (BRI) has both continental and maritime dimensions. Its media outlets, commercial companies, diplomats and military all have roles in Beijing's national strategy. Countering China's strategy will require a similar comprehensive diplomatic, economic and military response. Doctors have more time than thought to treat stroke patients, study suggests With additional research, however, that could happen.\n",
      "\"What was really exciting is that in vascular neurology, or stroke, we were forever stuck with treating patients by the clock rather than by what was actually going on in their brain,\" said Graffagnino, who was not involved in the study but saw parts of the research presented at the International Stroke Conference in February.\n",
      "\"We think this is just the beginning of using biology and not the clock to treat the right patients,\" he said.\n",
      "In the United States, someone has a stroke every 40 seconds, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n",
      "A benefit for rural or low-income health centers\n",
      "The new study involved 225 adults who had strokes between 2010 and 2018 in Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and Finland.\n",
      "1 in 4 globally will have a stroke at age 25 or older, according to new study\n",
      "The patients were randomly assigned to receive either a thrombolytic therapy or placebo between 4½ and nine hours after the onset of their strokes.\n",
      "The researchers found that recanalization, or restoration of blood flow, was achieved at 24 hours after the stroke in 67.3% of the patients in the therapy group, compared with 39.4% in the placebo group.\n",
      "The study also found that the degree of disability after the stroke, measured on what's called a modified Rankin scale, was zero or minimal among more patients in the therapy group, at 35.4%, compared with the patients in the placebo group, at 29.5%.\n",
      "The percentage of patients who died within 90 days of treatment or placebo did not differ significantly between the groups, according to the study.\n",
      "John Singleton's case highlights that strokes can happen at young age\n",
      "\"About 80% of the patients in this trial had large vessel clots, which means that they would actually be candidates for mechanical thrombectomy -- for pulling the clot out using a catheter -- and the success rate of pulling a clot out by catheter is much higher than the success rate of dissolving a clot with a medication,\" Graffagnino said.\n",
      "If a patient may not have access to thrombectomy, however, the study suggests that thrombolysis could be a beneficial option.\n",
      "\"This has really big implications for more distal places, more rural hospitals that are quite far from an advanced treatment center, for low- or middle-income countries where interventions, such as thrombectomy, are limited due to their resources,\" he said.\n",
      "Globally, about 70% of strokes and 87% of both stroke-related deaths and disabilities occur in low- and middle-income countries, according to the World Health Organization.\n",
      "The new study had some limitations, including a sample size smaller than intended, because the research was terminated early after positive results from a previous trial were published.\n",
      "'The era of time-based treatment ... may finally be drawing to a close'\n",
      "The new study \"reinforces the importance of individualizing acute stroke treatment and not simply excluding patients because of the time they were last seen normal,\" Dr. Fadi Nahab, medical director for the Stroke Program at Emory University Hospital, who was not involved in the study, wrote in an email.\n",
      "Many hospitals offer IV alteplase only if a patient experienced stroke symptoms within 4½ hours and exclude those who may have awoken from sleep with stroke symptoms because the onset time would be unknown, Nahab said.\n",
      "So the extension of that time window provides \"stroke center hospitals with additional opportunities to treat patients who come in within 4.5 to nine hours or who develop new stroke symptoms on awakening from sleep,\" he said.\n",

(CNN) — Hey. How you been?\n",
      "It's a simple question, but it yields fascinating answers when asked on a global scale.\n",
      "In 2018, US-based analytics company Gallup asked 151,000 people in 143 countries a series of questions about how they'd felt the day before. Were they angry or sad? Did they smile or laugh? Did they learn something new?\n",
      "The results were illuminating.\n",
      "While other studies, such as the World Happiness Report, focuses on variables such as income, health and social support, the annual Global Emotions Report is about how people reflect on their own lives -- and the outcome is quite different.\n",
      "Paraguayan positivity\n",
      "Five of Gallup's questions were about positive experiences. More than seven in 10 people worldwide said they experienced a lot of enjoyment (71%), felt well-rested (72%), smiled or laughed a lot (74%) and felt treated with\n",
      "respect (87%).\n",
      "Paraguay, the little South American country with the chilled-out reputation, ranked highest worldwide for Positive Experiences, and has held this position since 2015.\n",
      "Says the Gallup report, \"As they do year after year, Latin American countries dominated the list of countries in 2018 where adults reported feeling a lot of positive emotions each day. The high percentages reporting positive experiences in Latin America at least partly reflect the cultural tendency in the region to focus on life's positives.\"\n",
      "The Asian country of Indonesia was the only outlier. After Paraguay, the other most positive countries, in order, were Panama, Guatemala, Mexico, El Salvador, Indonesia, Honduras, Ecuador, Costa Rica and Colombia.\n",

      "Perhaps this social, family-oriented environment is why Nigerians were most likely to have said they'd smiled or laughed a lot the day before, with more than nine in 10 giving a positive answer.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Mongolia is the country that's got tranquility locked down, with 86% saying they felt well-rested.\n",

      "Less than half of people worldwide (49%) said they learned or did something interesting the day before the interview.\n",
      "So if you want to live a fulfilled life of of fresh experiences, moving to El Salvador, Panama or Guatemala is your best bet, since about three-quarters of these countries' respondents reported positive self-development.\n",
      "West African countries Senegal and Niger were close behind, with 73% and 72% respectively.\n",
      "Azerbaijan is a-okay\n",
      "The survey posed five questions to the interviewees relating to negative experiences: physical pain, worry, sadness, stress and anger.\n",
      "Gallup notes that \"countries with the lowest negative scores do not necessarily have the highest positive scores, \"adding that \"results on this index are related to country of origin, suggesting that cultural bias exists in how people answer these questions.\"\n",

The big winner from Trump's Iran oil boycott: Vladimir Putin With oil exports comprising some 60% of Russia's total merchandise exports and 30% of its GDP, every dollar increase in the price of oil translates immediately into a dramatic improvement in Russia's financial position. This cannot help but offset some of the impact of the sanctions that the United States and Western Europe continue to level on Russia as a result of the Kremlin's seizure of Crimea and its ongoing activities in Eastern Ukraine.\n",
      "In hard dollar terms, the impact is even more apparent. With Russia producing some 11 million barrels of oil a day, each dollar increase in the price per barrel of crude oil adds at least $4 billion to the Russian economy each year . Moreover, Russia ran a budget surplus last year that was close to 3% of its GDP, higher than forecast, as Russia's Economy Minister Maxim Oreshkin told the Financial Times in December. It was the first such annual budget surplus since 2011.\n",
      "As it happens, oil prices are one of the few economic indicators that are effectively a zero-sum game. While the oil price increases already anticipated by today's American action may boost Russia's economy, they also add substantially to the burden on America's allies in Western Europe, who consume some 13 million barrels of oil per day.\n",
      "Oil shoots above $65 on fears about Iran sanctions\n",
      "Moreover, there are other real threats to the Europe's oil supplies, particularly from the ongoing unrest in Libya, just across the Mediterranean, which had been pumping some 1.2 million barrels a day before the latest unrest, much of it destined for Europe. There are fears that unrest could lead to cutbacks of as much as half that output, further raising oil prices—and again providing another healthy boost to the Russian economy.\n",
      "At least Russia and China, a leading victim of Monday's Trump embargo action, have been preparing for this day for years. In January 2018, the second Russia-China oil pipeline came online, boosting Russia's capacity to satisfy rapidly expanding Chinese oil requirements—and more cheaply than with a long sea voyage in expensive super-tankers from Iran to the nearest Chinese oil port.\n",
      "But beyond all these short-term effects of Monday's decision to screw down the hold on Iran even tighter are other black swan impacts that can still be seen on the horizon. These include the ability of large multi-national companies, especially in the oil patch, to forecast accurately the supply-demand-price equations that figure deeply into their decisions to invest or their pricing of products that require large amounts of petroleum. Not to mention any sudden increase in gas prices at the pump as Americans head out for their summer holidays.\n",

      "The dream of eradicating widespread poverty in China didn't begin with Xi. It dates back to the Communist Party's rise to power in 1949. \"The reason for the existence of the Chinese Communist Party in the beginning is because of injustice and poverty among farmers,\" Donaldson said.\n",
      "Chairman Mao Zedong's economic experiments, however, actually set the country back, according to Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the University of London.\n",
      "\"In 1949, Shanghai was still a richer city than Hong Kong. In 1949, any coastal province was richer and more developed than Taiwan. In 1979, Hong Kong and Taiwan were way, way ahead,\" Tsang said.\n",
      "Mao's disastrous Great Leap Forward, beginning in 1958, was ostensibly an attempt to transform a mainly agrarian society through industrialization and collectivization. Instead, it helped create a famine that cost tens of millions of lives and aggravated poverty across the country.\n",
      "Things began to change after Mao's death. In 1978, then-paramount leader Deng Xiaoping began liberalizing China's economy and one of his first reforms was to let struggling farmers sell excess produce to make a profit.\n",

Almost 30 years later in 2019, Beijing says that number has dropped to just 16.6 million.\n",

      "Some older rural citizens have refused to go, while others have moved but then returned to their old homes.

      "Corruption and pollution\n",
      "Failure is not tolerated -- and the government is watching where its money is being spent.\n",
      "In March 2018, a provincial governor was kicked out of the Communist Party, partly for his failure to address poverty in his jurisdiction. In October that year, inspections were carried out in provinces across central and western China to check that officials were following orders on poverty alleviation.\n",
      "The flood of government and company funds allocated to deal with the issue has also revived the ever-present threat of corruption. More than 170,000 individuals were disciplined in 2018 alone for misappropriation of poverty alleviation funds, according to the party's anti-graft agency Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.\n",
      "There have also been signs that the government's laser-like focus on poverty is impeding another of its main goals -- environmental conservation.\n",
      "A 2015 research paper found evidence that work by the government to eradicate poverty by boosting the economy was lowering air and water quality in affected regions.\n",
      "Heavily polluting industries were encouraged to set up shop, bringing jobs and prosperity at the expense of the environment. Or natural resources were exploited for financial gain.\n",
      "\"Economic growth, poverty alleviation and ecological degradation do not appear to have de-coupled as required for long-term sustainable use of the environment, especially with regards to food security and access to clean water,\" the joint British and Chinese study said.\n",
      "Some critics also note that the government has focused mainly on poverty in the countryside rather than in cities, ignoring less severe but still-pressing urban hardship.\n",
      "'Absolutely confident'\n",
      "Wu, the Guizhou village poverty alleviation chief, said he was \"absolutely confident\" the 2020 goal could be met.\n",
      "\"The government is doing everything to achieve that. And on the micro level, the targeting of poverty population is really precise. It's not a problem if the entire society is making an effort,\" he said.\n",
      "China's Xi Jinping begins his most important year at his weakest point\n",
      "But experts and international observers say China's poverty goals achieve the bare minimum -- more work will be needed in the cities and the countryside to ensure everyone enjoys a high quality of life.\n",
      "Qin Gao, director of Columbia University's China Center for Social Policy, said in a 2018 report that broader government support for healthcare and employment would be more useful than initiatives on an individual basis or e-commerce measures.\n",
      "\"Only a combination of effective development measures and social policies and services can help China eradicate persisting rural poverty in the long run,\" she said.\n",
      "But Donaldson said that even if the target is met in 2020, he didn't believe the government would just abandon poverty as an issue.\n",
      "\"Any kind of responsible government would be focused on how you help improve the living standards of people who may not be poor but are still struggling,\" he said. \"I expect that to be on the agenda of the party forever.\" Marriott's big bet on Asia: 300 new hotels, butlers on WeChat and 60-second check-in Hotels in cities like London, New York and San Francisco — all popular destinations for Chinese visitors — are also trying to make them feel more at home.\n",

      "Challenges in China\n",
      "It hasn't always been easy for the world's biggest hotel chain to do business in China.\n",
      "Last year, Marriott's website was blocked for a week by Chinese authorities after its app listed Hong Kong, Macau, Tibet and Taiwan as separate \"countries.\"\n",
      "In December, hackers working for China's Ministry of State Security were accused of being behind a massive breach that exposed the data of up to 500 million customers of Marriott's Starwood Hotels.\n",
      "Marriott suffered a massive hack last year, but its CEO still made $13 million\n",
      "Linnartz said the company was determined to bounce back from both setbacks.\n",
      "\"Those are challenges and we certainly regret that both of them happened,\" she said.\n",
      "The country labeling incident was \"a mistake,\" Linnartz said, adding that the company was doing \"everything possible\" to prevent something like that happening again.\n",
      "Linnartz also stressed that Marriott would not speculate about \"who was involved\" in the data breach as it works with law enforcement around the world to investigate what happened.\n",
      "Internal issues aren't the only obstacle Marriott faces in China and the rest of Asia.\n",
      "Airbnb invests in India's biggest hotel company\n",
      "OYO, India's top hotel chain, claims it's adding rooms faster than the world's top three hotel groups combined.\n",
      "China is OYO's second biggest market — and this month, the company expanded into Japan through a new joint venture with SoftBank (SFTBF), one of its big-name investors alongside Airbnb.\n",
      "\"By 2023 we want to be the largest and most preferred hotel chain in the world,\" OYO told CNN Business recently.\n",
      "Linnartz was reluctant to comment on OYO, but added that she doesn't see the startup competing with Marriott \"in the luxury space.\"\n",
      "Future of hotels\n",
      "Marriott is counting on innovation in China to help beat off competitors.\n",
      "Last summer, two of its hotels debuted facial recognition technology, allowing guests to check-in within 60 seconds using software from a joint venture with China's Alibaba (BABA).\n",
      "That partnership is \"one of the things that I've been most excited about in the past couple of years,\" said Linnartz.\n",
      "The technology is still in the pilot stage, but Marriott hopes eventually to roll it out globally.\n",
      "Facial recognition technology was introduced at two Marriott hotels in Hangzhou and Sanya, China last year.\n",
      "{\"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"name\": \"Facial recognition technology was introduced at two Marriott hotels in Hangzhou and Sanya, China last year.\",\"description\": \"Facial recognition technology was introduced at two Marriott hotels in Hangzhou and Sanya, China last year.\",\"url\": \"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190412174459-marriott-facial-recognition-tech-large-169.jpg\",}\n",
      "It's the 92-year-old company's latest major effort to shake things up.\n",
      "Last year, it partnered with Amazon (AMZN) to let visitors use Echo devices to order room service or call the front desk. Linnartz, who describes keeping up with tech trends as a key challenge of her job, says she is constantly looking at how experiences like augmented reality could be brought into Marriott hotels.\n",
      "But while automation has changed the game, the human touch is still vital.\n",
      "\"I think the key is about giving consumers choice,\" she said. \"It still comes to the warm smile at your door with the coffee or whatever, right?\" A goddess inspired a Taiwanese billionaire to follow Trump's example Tsai announced her intention to run in February this year, after bruising local election losses in 2018 saw her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) hemorrhaging votes island-wide.\n",
      "The DPP has traditionally favored moves toward formalizing Taiwan's de facto independence from China. Since she took power in 2016, Tsai has attempted to diversify the island's economy from being too dependent on its large neighbor, while pushing back against what she views as Beijing's aggressive expansionism.\n",
      "In turn, Beijing has ramped up pressure on Taiwan, conducting large scale military drills around the island, including sailing the Liaoning aircraft carrier through the Taiwan Strait. Speaking in January, Chinese President Xi Jinping urged Taiwan to embrace \"peaceful reunification\" with China, saying that independence was a \"dead end.\"\n",
      "Should he become president, Gou will likely be challenged with repairing this relationship, while maintaining Taiwan's traditionally strong ties with Washington.\n",
      "He will have a better claim than many candidates for being able to do so -- Foxconn has made billions through deep involvement in the Chinese economy, where many of its manufacturing plants are based, producing electronics for many American tech companies, most notably Apple.\n",
      "Gou himself also has strong ties to the United States, and has met US President Donald Trump, who has called him \"a friend of mine\" and \"one of the most successful businessmen in the world.\"\n",
      "The People's Daily, a mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, said on Wednesday that \"Gou has a unique advantage in dealing with the relations between Taiwan and Mainland, and the US.\"\n",
      "Taiwan will elect its next President on January 11, 2020.\n",

      "Blessings from a goddess\n",
      "Gou announced his candidacy this week after visiting a temple in Taipei dedicated to the Taoist deity Mazu, guardian angel of seafarers.\n",
      "Wearing a bright red vest and a baseball cap showing the flag of the Republic of China -- the official name for Taiwan -- Gou said that Mazu had given her blessing to his candidacy.\n",
      "\"If Mazu says that you should step up, it is not in order to make money or for personal enjoyment,\" Gou told reporters. \"I tell you, I am like a godson to Mazu ... I will definitely respect and follow Mazu's will.\"\n",
      "Speaking later at KMT headquarters -- still wearing his cap -- Gou said he was \"willing to participate in the primary elections.\"\n",
      "\"I am not willing to accept being appointed (without being elected), I am definitely not willing to accept being appointed. If elected, I will represent the Kuomintang in the 2020 contest,\" he said. \"If I am not elected, it means that I didn't try hard enough.\"\n",
      "In a statement, Foxconn said Gou would only run for president, \"if the primary process - which is still being determined by party leadership - is open, transparent, and grounded.\"\n",
      "\"When and if this determination is made, Mr. Gou will run in the KMT's primary to seek the party nomination for President,\" a spokeswoman said.\n",

      "As well as Mazu, Gou may have been inspired by another source: Trump. According to multiple media reports, the Foxconn chairman is rumored to have been inspired by Trump's 2016 run and began thinking that he too could be President.\n",
      "Margaret Lewis, a Taiwan expert at the Seton Hall University School of Law, compared Gou's candidacy to Trump's, and warned against underestimating the Taiwanese billionaire.\n",
      "\"Even though he's obviously flawed in many ways as a candidate, populism can be powerful,\" she said. \"It would be a mistake to treat his run too lightly.\"\n",
      "While Gou is definitely an outsider candidate -- according to state media, he hasn't been a KMT member since 2000 -- he's received backing from key party figures, with former leader and President of Taiwan, Ma Ying-jeou, saying he was \"an ideal candidate.\"\n",
      "Lev Nachman, an expert on Taiwanese politics at the University of California, Irvine, said that Gou had one thing in particular that the KMT needs: Funding.\n",
      "\"Terry Gou is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Taiwan and would essentially be able to finance his own campaign,\" he said. \"That's a big deal for the KMT right now.\"\n",

      "Support from Beijing?\n",
      "Despite once fighting a civil war with the Communist Party for rule over China -- before defeat forced the Republic of China government to retreat to Taiwan -- the KMT has in recent decades been the party of closer ties and engagement with Beijing.\n",
      "Former President Ma held historic talks with China's Xi in 2015, and his administration massively ramped up cross-straits economic activity, including a controversial trade deal that sparked mass protests known as the Sunflower Movement, which are credited with helping carry Tsai and her DPP to the presidency.\n",
      "Gou's connections to China are manifold. His company Foxconn employs hundreds of thousands of people in factories and manufacturing plants across China.\n",
      "\"Gou is an integral player in the Chinese economy and becoming president would put him in a position to very closely tie Taiwan into China's economy in ways Tsai has fought against such as her New Southbound Policy which tried to extend Taiwan's trade beyond just China,\" Nachman said.\n",
      "Foxconn could also be a potential concern for voters, however.\n",
      "So far, the company has been tight-lipped over what a Gou run for president will exactly mean for his relations with the company he founded.\n",
      "A spokeswoman said that at present Gou remains chairman, and would \"continue to provide strategic direction and guidance,\" as he seeks the KMT nomination.\n",
      "\"That's the million dollar question. Who is Gou loyal to? Taiwan? Foxconn? Both? If the answer is Foxconn or both, that puts Taiwan in a bad position with Gou as president because Foxconn's success is tied to, coercively or not, the Chinese state,\" Nachman said.\n",
      "\"In the same way Trump only marginally divested from his assets when he became president, I would not expect Gou to truly move away from his (company),\" he added.\n",
      "\"I would be greatly concerned with Gou's ability to separate his business from his political endeavors. Given Foxconn's position within the Chinese economy and Gou's political ideals, I'm not sure he even can or wants to.\"\n",
      "Lewis, the Seton Hall professor, also cautioned against assuming that Gou -- or any other KMT President -- would be able to magically fix relations with Beijing.\n",
      "\"Ma Ying-jeou met with Xi Jinping, but I don't think it's fair to compare the Xi Jinping of 2015 with the Xi Jinping of 2019,\" she said. \"He's been able to take on a more assertive position in recent years.\"\n",

      "Can he win?\n",
      "Gou has said repeatedly that he does not want to be simply anointed as KMT candidate, and will fight the party's primary.\n",
      "This could be a close run for the billionaire, with multiple other candidates and potential candidates, including Han Kuo-yu, who Gou himself previously said would be a \"terrific\" president.\n",
      "Han, a hugely popular KMT mayor of the southern city of Kaohsiung, has not officially announced his candidacy, but had been seen in recent weeks as frontrunner to be the party's eventual pick. He recently toured the US, meeting with lawmakers and business leaders, a traditional first step to declaring a run for president.\n",
      "\"Han Kuo-yu is a very interesting, unusual person,\" Lewis said. \"He has has not set forth clear policies, going with a much more flashy, 'I'm something different even if you don't know what that is' approach.\"\n",
      "As Kaohsiung mayor, Han has increased engagement with China, and would be expected to follow a similar path to Gou's, which Lewis described as a \"general willingness to engage with China, particularly economically, and a belief that engagement can be confined to the economic.\"\n",
      "\"Han does currently have an unmatched level of popularity in Taiwan right now,\" Nachman said. \"Han has also shown, especially during his most recent trip to Hong Kong, that he, like Gou, is willing to build strong connections to the CCP and push for a more pro-unification agenda.\"\n",
      "With both Gou and Han favoring closer ties with China, Nachman said there was even a small possibility they could end up working together, on a ticket that could dramatically reshape politics both within the KMT and Taiwan at large.\n",
      "\"That would be the most blatantly pro-unification team to ever be seriously considered for presidential leadership,\" he said. \"It could very much lead to the end of the current status quo as we know it.\" State Department approves renewal of $500 million Taiwan military training program The proposed sale is unrelated to Taiwan's reported plans to purchase new F-16 fighter jets from the US, according to the State Department official.\n",
      "Taiwan accused China of \"reckless and provocative\" action after two Chinese air force jets crossed a maritime border separating the island from the mainland on March 31.\n",
      "The island's military scrambled fighter planes after it said two Chinese J-11 fighter jets crossed the border within the waters of the Taiwan Strait, known as the median line. The incident triggered a 10-minute standoff between jets from the two sides.\n",
      "If confirmed as intentional, the Chinese incursion would be the first of its kind in years, said Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 30 years after Tiananmen massacre, Taiwan shows another way for China For decades, the Nationalist Party (KMT) whose soldiers carried out the 2/28 massacre prevented official investigation of the bloodshed. The size of the death toll thus remains uncertain, though it is believed to be between several thousand and 25,000.\n",
      "In 1977, 30 years after 2/28, the KMT continued to ban all discussion of the event.\n",

      "In 1977, Taiwan was still, like today's PRC, under one-party authoritarian rule.\n",
      "A key reason the memories of the 1947 massacre threatened the KMT in 1977 and memories of the 1989 massacre threaten the CCP now is that, in each killing, soldiers touted as benevolent defenders of the people behaved like brutal invaders.\n",
      "Today however, Taiwan is a democracy, and 2/28 is marked nationwide as Peace Memorial Day. What can we learn from the similarities between the massacres -- and that the KMT eventually apologized for 2/28?\n",
      "After Japan's 1945 surrender in World War II, Chiang Kai-shek's forces seized Taiwan and claimed it for the ROC, which then included much of the territory of today's PRC. Heavy-handed efforts to subdue the island by Chiang's KMT were, not surprisingly, met with resistance. Tensions flared on February 27, 1947, when police struck a widow who was selling cigarettes illegally. Big protests broke out. The next day KMT soldiers fired on crowds.\n",
      "Chiang's government denied that a massacre had occurred and stuck to this position long after Mao Zedong's forces drove the KMT from the Chinese mainland.\n",
      "On the 30th anniversary of the massacre, a public reckoning with the event seemed no more likely than a full investigation into Tiananmen does today. But that changed.\n",

      "Taiwan's past, China's future\n",
      "Even though only one of the massacres can be openly discussed in the place in which it occurred, there are three ways in which thinking about 2/28's legacy helps put that of 6/4 into perspective.\n",
      "First, by showing that the histories of authoritarian systems often take unexpected turns.\n",
      "Hopes for a long-term relaxation of repression in the PRC have proved chimerical. The CCP has been remarkably resilient. But Taiwan's case reminds us that even resilient objects break.\n",
      "The ROC was under martial law for decades. As late as 1979, the KMT used force to crush pro-democracy protesters in Kaohsiung, Taiwan's second biggest city. In the 1980s, however, democracy activists asserted themselves with a vigor that took many observers by surprise, and, in 1986, Chiang Ching-kuo, Chiang Kai-shek's son and successor, unexpectedly reversed his father's policies and allowed for formal establishment of an opposition party. Martial law eventually ended in 1987.\n",
      "Second, multiple forces can drive change.\n",
      "Political activists, long-time officials, and other actors played important roles in Taiwan's democratization. This suggests the need to avoid letting PRC President Xi Jinping's current emphasis on control engender myopia. Even when a confident strongman is on top, it is worth keeping an eye out for forces bubbling under the surface.\n",
      "Third, change is a long slog.\n",
      "It's worth remembering that the ROC did not have its first direct presidential election until 1996. And its first non-KMT President was not elected until 2000.\n",
      "Taiwan's history does not tell us what will happen in the PRC in the near future, but it does give us reason to hope that policies -- including how 6/4 is remembered and discussed -- can eventually change.\n",
      "The question that remains is how, and when? Bungee cord to the eye causes man's iris to collapse This second examination of the patient's left eye revealed an iris \"with the upper portion sagging downward, detached from the 9 o'clock position to the 3 o'clock position,\" Chen and Hsiao wrote in a case study on the man's injury, published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n",
      "A separation of the iris like this \"can cause multiple pupils, leading to monocular double vision, blurry vision or photophobia\" (an inability to tolerate light), they told CNN in an email.\n",
      "Laser pointer burns hole in boy's retina\n",
      "So what caused the rare injury? A rubber bungee cord that the man used to strap goods onto a motorcycle had struck him directly in the eye.\n",
      "The iris is \"what we recognize as the colored part of the eye,\" explained Dr. Nicholas P. Bell, a professor of ophthalmology and visual science with McGovern Medical School at UTHealth in Houston.\n",
      "\"Muscles in the iris can cause the pupil to open or close to control how much light gets into the eye under different ambient lighting conditions, similar to how you can adjust the aperture on a camera lens,\" said Bell, who did not treat this particular patient. In a dark room, the pupil opens wide to let in more light, and on a sunny day, the pupil will constrict to reduce the amount of incoming light.\n",
      "Though Chen and Hsiao saw no evidence of cataract, retinal injury or lens dislocation, the separation of the iris from the band of muscles that sits behind it easily accounted for the patient's blurred and double vision. This damage is known as traumatic iridodialysis.\n",
      "Group of rare eye cancer cases baffles experts\n",
      "Bell said the condition is \"relatively uncommon,\" though when it does occur, sports or work-related activities are often the cause. But there are others. \"Bungee cord and airbag injuries seem to more frequently result in traumatic iridodialysis because of the focally concentrated strong force,\" Bell said, adding that airbags save lives, and fear of this extremely rare eye injury is no reason for avoiding them.\n",
      "Dr. J. Martin Heur, medical director of the USC Roski Eye Institute and associate professor of clinical ophthalmology at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, agreed that this injury is \"very rare, but I've had a handful of people who've had this happen to them.\" \"The trauma can be caused by anything that doesn't penetrate the eye\" but still causes \"the iris to tear at the root like that,\" said Heur, who was not involved in this patient's care. Balls such as golf balls are likely culprits, he said.\n",
      "To repair the damage, the Taiwanese patient underwent surgery that restored the pupil shape and improved his vision.\n",
      "Heur said this surgery, known as iridoplasty, is \"usually done in an operating room\" and \"is relatively short: approximately 30 minutes.\" The procedure involves McCannel sutures, basically when a surgeon carefully sews the iris back to the inner wall of the eye.\n",
      "These health problems can be predicted with a look into your eyes\n",
      "Heur added that after an iridoplasty, a patient has to be careful for about a week or two about lifting heaving objects or getting water in the eye. Once healed, a patient needs to be monitored regularly for life, because glaucoma can develop even years after the injury.\n",
      "One year later, the Taiwan patient's iris remained attached with only \"mild deformity,\" Chen and Hsiao said. Though there's no evidence of glaucoma so far, the patient now wears glasses to help him achieve 20/50 vision in the injured eye: He needs to be within 20 feet to see what people with healthy vision can spot at 50 feet.\n",
      "Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg, a professor and chair of ophthalmology at the Byers Eye Institute at Stanford University, said he saw a similarly severe injury \"after a fisherman had a steel cable snap back into his eye.\"\n",
      "The health benefits of a colorful life\n",
      "\"Because some of the effects of eye trauma can be asymptomatic and appear four to six weeks later, it is important to get a complete eye exam with a professional eye care provider both immediately after severe trauma and a month or two later to be safe,\" said Goldberg, who did not treat the Taiwanese patient.\n",
      "Although this level of injury is rare, \"less severe iridodialyses happen more often with moderate to severe eye trauma,\" he said. When small tears occur on the very edge of the iris, they can \"lead to scarring on that area that subsequently blocks the drain of the eye, leading to higher eye pressure and glaucoma.\"\n",

      "Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n",
      "Dr. Jeff Pettey, an assistant professor at the University of Utah's John A. Moran Eye Center, added BB guns and exercise bands to the list of items that can cause an injury like this: \"A young flight attendant used exercise bands when she traveled, and her eye injury resulted in severe eye trauma and a blind eye.\"\n",
      "To avoid a similar injury, you can read the American Academy of Ophthalmology's website for eye safety tips, a list that includes using protective eyewear whenever playing sports, performing home maintenance ... or using bungee cords. Executions worldwide are at a 10-year low. But in the US, they rose \"There has been a slight increase in the number of executions [in the US], but it is still within historical lows,\" Chiara Sangiorgio, Amnesty International's Advisor on the Death Penalty, told CNN. \"Over a 10-year-period, we have seen the number of both executions and death sentences decrease.\"\n",
      "The death penalty is rare in the US, but is still legal in most states\n",
      "The death penalty is legal in 30 US states, but that number doesn't paint an accurate picture of its actual prevalence. For instance, four US states in which the death penalty is legal are under statewide capital punishment moratoriums imposed by their respective governors. Furthermore, there are several states that recognize the death penalty, but haven't actually executed anyone in years.\n",

      "Sangiorgio says Amnesty International monitors legislative changes and leadership decisions to provide additional insight to their numbers.\n",
      "\"We are seeing a few states resume executions after several years, so we find that concerning,\" Sangiorgio says. \"But the trend in the US is positive. [In 2018], Washington became the 20th state to abolish the death penalty. And we recently saw a strong example of leadership coming from California, where [Governor Gavin Newsom] recently suspended the death penalty.\"\n",
      "Global and national trends account for other decreases\n",
      "Sangiorgio says the historically low number of executions in 2018 was due in part to a significant drop in sentences carried out in some of the world's leading executing countries. For instance, Iran has historically been one of the world's leading executing countries, and the number of executions there dropped by more than 50% in 2018.\n",
      "\"There was a significant drop in executions for drug related offenses in Iran, because of a change in the laws from last year,\" Sangiorgio says. Other countries that lead the implementation of the death penalty, like Pakistan and Iraq, saw an ease in unsually high numbers from last year.\n",
      "And again, the numbers are only half the story.\n",
      "\"There is reason for positive hopes, not only in the drop of executions, but in the number of countries that have decided to abolish the practice,\" Sangiorgio says. \"Burkina Faso, Zambia and Malaysia all abolished or moved toward abolishing the death penalty this year.\" However, she points out that other countries like Japan, Singapore and Taiwan resumed executing people after a period of inactivity.\n",
      "When it comes to execution statistics, there is also a China-sized elephant in the room: Since 2009, Amnesty International hasn't counted the number of executions reported in China.\n",
      "\"China has yet to publish any figures on the death penalty; however, available information indicates that each year, thousands of people are executed and sentenced to death,\" the report reads.\n",
      "Amnesty International's reporting also clarifies that many of their numbers are technically minimum estimates, which is why language like \"at least 690 executions\" is used . Kirsten Gillibrand takes questions at CNN town hall What we covered here\n",

      "\"I think anyone should be able to have faith, whether they're ultraconservative or liberal. And if you're coming from a Christian perspective, I would say the gospel doesn't leave anybody out. Because are you feeding the poor? Are you helping the sick? Are you visiting the incarcerated? Do you believe in helping the least among us? Do you believe in the golden rule? Do you treat others the way you want to be treated? I would argue the Democrats are often better on those issues than Republicans. So there's no reason you can't be a person of any faith in any political party.\"\n",

      "Gillibrand casts her record on guns from a conservative NY district as a benefit, not a flaw\n",
      "From CNN's Dan Merica\n",
      "Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand argued on Tuesday that the fact she once held an A-rating with the National Rifle Association makes her better equipped to talk to gun owners about the need for gun control.\n",
      "Gillibrand, a mother of two, also said the way to reach conservatives on this issue is to make it about family and children.\n",
      "“I think I can walk into any voter in a red state or a purple state or a blue state, gun owners, NRA members, and say, you do care about a four-year-old dying on a park bench in Brooklyn, don’t you,” Gillibrand said. “And the humanity of each person in this country should kick in.”\n",
      "She added: “And you are going to ask them to imagine that happening to their own child, their own loved one, and their own family. And I think you can change hearts that way.”\n",
      "Gillibrand said earlier this year that she was “embarrassed” by her past positions on guns. She began to changed her position after she became a senator and met with Jennifer Pryear and Alberto Yard, the parents of Nyasia Pryear-Yard, a young woman who was killed in a 2009 shooting in Brooklyn.\n",
      "“So, I had an A-rating as a House member,” she said in Iowa earlier this year. “I only really looked at guns through the lens of hunting. My mother still shoots the Thanksgiving turkey. But when I became senator, I recognized I had a lot to learn about my state and all of the 20 million I was going to represent.”\n",

      "Asked if she would support making vaccines mandatory, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said she needed to think about it before answering, but she added that parents need more information on preventable diseases overall.\n",
      "\"I haven't thought about whether I would make it mandatory. I would need to think about that. But I do believe that parents need more information about why vaccines are so essential. Parents need to know that their child could die of preventable diseases, that they could spread a preventable disease and other children could die,\" she said.\n",
      "Gillibrand said she thinks vaccines save lives and that parents are just afraid because of rumors and myths.\n",
      "\"I think parents have been afraid. I think they've been made afraid by rumors and myths and, you know, fake news. So I think that we need to do a much better job of educating parents about the essential nature of vaccines. It does save lives, and I will work as hard as I can to make sure that every parent knows that vaccines are absolutely necessary,\" she said.\n",

      "By Veronica Stracqualursi, CNN UK lawmakers warn journalists and activists could be extradited to China under new law Fear that the law will allow dissidents and pro-democracy activists to be bundled over the border to China has dogged the bill since it was first suggested, however.\n",
      "Business groups too have expressed concerns, prompting the government to remove nine economic crimes from the list of potentially extraditable offenses. The government also changed the minimum severity of offense from those carrying one year in prison to three.\n",
      "In a statement responding to those changes, the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) said members continued \"to have serious concerns about the revised proposal.\"\n",
      "\"Those concerns flow primarily from the fact that the new arrangements could be used for rendition from Hong Kong to a number of jurisdictions with criminal procedure systems very different from that of Hong Kong -- which provides strong protections for the legitimate rights of defendants -- without the opportunity for public and legislative scrutiny of the fairness of those systems and the specific safeguards that should be sought in cases originating from them,\" the AmCham statement said.\n",
      "\"We strongly believe that the proposed arrangements will reduce the appeal of Hong Kong to international companies considering Hong Kong as a base for regional operations.\"\n",
      "Protesters march along a street during a rally in Hong Kong on March 31, 2019, to protest against the government's plans to approve extraditions with mainland China, Taiwan and Macau.\n",
      "{\"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"name\": \"Protesters march along a street during a rally in Hong Kong on March 31, 2019, to protest against the government&#39;s plans to approve extraditions with mainland China, Taiwan and Macau.\",\"description\": \"Protesters march along a street during a rally in Hong Kong on March 31, 2019, to protest against the government&#39;s plans to approve extraditions with mainland China, Taiwan and Macau.\",\"url\": \"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190408082341-hong-kong-extradition-law-01-large-169.jpg\",}\n",
      "Responding to reporter's questions about the law last month, Hong Kong Secretary for Security John Lee said the extradition law was part of the city's \"international commitment to fight organized crime.\"\n",
      "He said the foreign business community should support the effort, which \"will benefit (the) business environment.\"\n",
      "\"If the accusation is that somebody may unwittingly become a political offender, then I have said repeatedly that the law at present, under our Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, has clearly stated that this will not be possible,\" Lee added.\n",
      "\"There is a provision to say that no matter how you purport that offense to be, if it relates to political opinion, religion, nationality or ethnicity, then it will not be surrenderable.\"\n",
      "AmCham's statement is part of a growing chorus of condemnation of the law from multiple quarters. Critics of the law point to past situations where people have been snatched in Hong Kong and transported to China to face trial, including multiple booksellers and Chinese businessman Xiao Jianhua.\n",
      "Last week, the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) said the new law could enable the Chinese government to extradite reporters critical of Beijing, saying it would \"not only threaten the safety of journalists but also have a chilling effect on the freedom of expression in Hong Kong.\"\n",
      "\"Over the years, numerous journalists have been charged or harassed by mainland authorities with criminal allegations covered by the (law),\" it said.\n",
      "\"The (law) will make it possible for mainland authorities to get hold of journalists in Hong Kong (on) all kinds of unfounded charges. This sword hanging over journalists will muzzle both the journalists and the whistleblowers, bringing an end to the limited freedom of speech that Hong Kong still enjoys.\"\n",
      "The Hong Kong Bar Association has also criticized the new law, and questioned the government's assertion that there were loopholes in the city's current arrangements. Federal prosecutors say woman illegally entered Trump's Mar-a-Lago club After agents were alerted to Zhang's presence, she told them she was there to attend a \"United Nations Friendship Event\"between the United States and China, and produced what she claimed was an invitation to the event, the complaint says. But \"agents were unable to read it as it was in Chinese.\" No such event was scheduled to take place on the property at that time.\n",
      "Trump was staying at Mar-a-Lago on that date, though he was not on the property at the time of Zhang's alleged visit.\n",
      "After she was detained, agents found she had multiple electronic devices including four cellphones, a laptop computer, an external \"hard drive type\" device and a thumb drive.\n",
      "A preliminary investigation found malicious malware on the thumb drive, prosecutors say.\n",
      "Late Tuesday, US Attorney's office spokeswoman Sarah Schall said the two passports Zhang was carrying were from the People's Republic of China. The complaint had indicated they were from the Republic of China, commonly known as Taiwan.\n",
      "\"Information presented to the court indicates that the defendant is from the People's Republic of China, not Republic of China (Taiwan), and they were PRC passports,\" Schall said in an email.\n",
      "When asked about the incident Wednesday, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang said he had \"no information\" on Zhang's arrest.\n",
      "The complaint raises numerous questions about Zhang's purpose on the property. When agents interviewed her, she\"claimed her Chinese friend 'Charles' told her to travel from Shanghai, China, to Palm Beach, Florida, to attend this event and attempt to speak with a member of the President's family about Chinese and American foreign economic relations,\" according to the complaint.\n",
      "Agents tried to find out more about \"Charles,\" but Zhang claimed she had contact with him only through WeChat, a messaging service that is popular in China.\n",
      "\"Due to a potential language barrier issue,\" the complaint says, Mar-a-Lago believed her to be a relative of a member.\n",
      "But during the interviews with agents, the complaint states, she \"exhibited a detailed knowledge of, and ability to converse in and understand even subtle nuances of, the English language.\"\n",
      "\"For example, as agents were attempting to obtain written consent for examination of electronic devices found in her possession, Zhang read the entire form in English out loud to agents,\" it says.\n",
      "Prosecutors in the Southern District of Florida charged her Monday with one count of making a false statement to a federal officer and one count of entering restricted property.\n",
      "Zhang made a brief initial appearance in Florida federal court Monday where she was advised of the charges against her and the possible penalties she faced. She is due back in court for a detention hearing on April 8.\n",
      "In a statement late Tuesday, the US Secret Service said Mar-a-Lago club management is responsible for deciding who is allowed access to the property, noting that \"this access does not afford an individual proximity to the President or other Secret Service protectees.\"\n",
      "\"While the Secret Service does not determine who is permitted to enter the club, our agents and officers conduct physical screenings to ensure no prohibited items are allowed onto the property,\" the statement said.\n",
      "It added that \"with the exception of certain permanently protected facilities, such as the White House, the practice used at Mar-a-Lago is no different than that long-used at any other site temporarily visited by the President or other Secret Service protectees.\n",
      "Correction: This story has been updated to clarify Mar-a-Lago staff admitted Zhang to the property and that Zhang told Mar-a-Lago staff she was there to attend a United Nations Chinese American Association event, according to the criminal complaint. The complaint also states that Mar-a-Lago staff, not the Secret Service, believed Zhang was related to a club member.\n",
      "This story was also updated to correct the attribution of the country of the passports Zhang was carrying. Apple cuts iPhone prices in China Apple (AAPL) declined to comment on the price changes.\n",
      "The company raised alarm bells in January when CEO Tim Cook warned investors that \"more severe\" economic conditions in China weighed on iPhone sales last year.\n",
      "Cook later told Reuters that Apple would lower iPhone prices in some markets outside the United States to offset the strong US dollar.\n",
      "Apple made AirPods even better with three impressive features\n",
      "But the iPhone had already been struggling in China, even before the country's economy showed signs of slowing and the weak Chinese yuan bumped up prices.\n",
      "Apple's smartphone sales in China have been declining for more than three years and plunged by 20% last quarter, according to market research firm IDC.\n",
      "The California company faces stiff competition from domestic rivals like Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi, which all offer cheaper, high-end smartphones tailored for the Chinese market.\n",
      "\"Even with this price reduction, these iPhones are still more expensive than the competing ones from those such as Huawei,\" said Kiranjeet Kaur, an analyst with IDC.\n",
      "Still, China remains a key market for Apple, accounting for more than 15% of total sales. Revenue from the Greater China region — which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan — fell about 27% to $13.2 billion last quarter compared to the same period a year earlier. Philippines protests hundreds of Chinese ships around disputed island China's ambassador to the Philippines, Zhao Jianhua, said Beijing was trying to verify how many vessels were around Thitu. They might be \"unarmed\" fishing vessels, he said, according to CNN Philippines.\n",
      "Thitu island is in the disputed Spratlys chain, which includes Chinese-controlled atolls and reefs that Beijing has built up and developed with buildings, ports and runways over the past several years.\n",
      "Philippines opposition lawmaker Gary Alejano said Saturday that the Duterte administration should not let China establish any long-term presence around Thitu.\n",
      "\"China is establishing a norm there which we cannot alter later on. Every day is a wasted opportunity to assert our sovereignty if we do not act now,\" he said, according to CNN Philippines.\n",

Houtong: Taiwan village saved by hundreds of adorable stray cats (CNN) — From the moment you arrive at Houtong Village in northern Taiwan, you'll have no trouble knowing who the real stars are.\n",

      "The fall and rise of Houtong\n",
      "Stray cats have helped revive Houtong, a sleepy former mining village.\n",
      "SAM YEH/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n",
      "In the early 1900s, Houtong, in New Taipei City, was the biggest and most technologically advanced coal-mining site in Taiwan. It was a prosperous town with about 6,000 residents and workers, before the mine fell into disuse in 1990.\n",
      "As most young residents moved away for better opportunities, Houtong became a sleepy village with about 100 residents.\n",
      "But in 2010, Houtong's fame surged after a cat lover and photographer started blogging about the village's growing stray cat population. Houtong was transformed into a cat-lover mecca while also providing a source of income for local villagers.\n",
      "Many of the stray cats, now given affectionate nicknames, are taken care of by local villagers as well as a troop of volunteers.\n",
      "In addition to the village's many cute kitty-themed shops and cafes, the local government has also seized the opportunity to revamp Houtong and highlight its long history.\n",
      "Cat-viewing maps help visitors plan feline-packed walking routes.\n",
      "SAM YEH/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n",
      "An award-winning pedestrian cat bridge was built. Metal plates featuring tiny paw designs were embedded into streets. A cat information and education center opened in 2014, featuring elevated cat walkways on the façade of the building.\n",
      "A museum park dedicated to the town's former mining life opened in 2010, later hosting a cat lantern festival in 2012.\n",
      "It all appears to be paying off. The town now draws an estimated one million visitors every year.\n",
      "Controversies\n",
      "The stray cats, taken care of by locals and volunteers, have been given affectionate nicknames. This is Xiaohua (or Little Flower).\n",

      "But Houtong, now under the spotlight, isn't completely purrfect.\n",
      "According to local reports, the town has become a magnet for those looking for a place to abandon their unwanted pets.\n",
      "During the most recent survey, the New Taipei City Government Animal Protection and Health Inspection Office estimated that the village is now home to about 286 cats -- 50 heads more than two years ago.\n",

New Zealand's special relationship with China is on the rocks. Can Jacinda Ardern's Beijing trip save it? But Jason Young, director of the New Zealand Contemporary China Research Center, said over the past few years more and more issues have come between the two countries.\n",

      "Growing tensions\n",
      "The China-New Zealand relationship is one that Ardern's predecessors have taken care to foster.\n",
      "Key visited the country six times during his eight years as leader. Under Prime Minister Helen Clark, New Zealand in 2008 became the first developed country to sign a free-trade agreement with China.\n",
      "Today, China is New Zealand's largest trading partner. Two-way trade between the countries was valued at more than $19 billion (28 billion New Zealand dollars) in 2018, according to New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Trade. China is also New Zealand's second-largest tourism market and largest source of international students.\n",
      "New Zealand PM denies rift with China after Huawei ban\n",
      "However Wellington's ties to Beijing have raised alarm bells with the United States, New Zealand's longtime ally.\n",
      "Along with Washington, New Zealand is a member of the exclusive intelligence sharing community known as \"Five Eyes,\" which also consists of the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia.\n",
      "In an extraordinary statement to the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission in April 2018, former US government analyst Peter Mattis said New Zealand's membership should be reviewed given its relationship with Beijing.\n",
      "\"Australia and New Zealand both face substantial problems with interference by the Chinese Communist Party. In both cases, the CCP has gotten very close to or inside the political core, if you will, of both countries,\" Mattis told the commission.\n",
      "Juggling the relationship with the US and China has become increasingly difficult for New Zealand, with relations between the two giants souring amid US President Donald Trump's escalating trade war.\n",
      "Tensions with Beijing reached a new level in 2018 when New Zealand's Government Communications Security Bureau blocked Chinese technology company Huawei from providing 5G technology to one of the country's major telecommunication companies, Spark.\n",
      "The US has been putting pressure on its allies and diplomatic partners to ditch Huawei over security concerns, a move which has been regularly condemned by Beijing.\n",
      "Speaking to CNN in February, Andrew Campbell, a spokesman for Ardern, said the relationship had suffered some \"irritation ... because of the GCSB's decision regarding Huawei.\"\n",
      "When asked whether Huawei would be on the agenda this weekend, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang evaded the question.\n",
      "Ardern on the back foot\n",
      "In recent months, Ardern has found herself under greater pressure from opposition politicians and critics to defend the strength of New Zealand's relationship with China.\n",
      "In February, Ardern was forced to deny that China was deliberately dragging out the visa process for New Zealander diplomats and postponing trips by officials to Beijing.\n",
      "The same month, local media reported an Air New Zealand flight to Shanghai was mysteriously forced to turn back to Auckland on discovering that its paperwork referred to the disputed island of Taiwan.\n",
      "At the time, Ardern denied it was a \"relationship\" issue with China, saying instead it was an administrative error.\n",
      "But the postponement of a major Chinese-New Zealand tourism event that same month -- which Ardern put down to a scheduling issue -- also added to speculation of a rift.\n",
      "Ardern's trip also comes at a sensitive time for New Zealand, just two weeks after the terrorist attack against two mosques in Christchurch in which 50 people died. She even said she would be cutting her trip to China short, as it didn't seem \"appropriate\" to be overseas at such a time.\n",
      "Following global praise for her handling of the tragedy, the New Zealand leader has come under pressure from human rights group to raise the issue of China's crackdown on Uyghur Muslims with Xi. Up to two million Uyghurs have reportedly been detained in detention centers in the western region of Xinjiang, according to US government reports.\n",
      "\"Given I've raised it before, that should give you an indication,\" she said when asked by reporters this week.\n",
      "Prior to her trip, a spokesman for the Prime Minister denied again that she was concerned about the relationship with China worsening under her leadership. \"China is one of our most important and far-reaching relationships. Our relationship is mature and resilient,\" the spokesman said.\n",
      "China researcher Young agreed with the official line.\n",
      "\"I think if the relationship really was deteriorating in that way, then it would be far clearer. I think China would be a lot more blunt in the message if it was wanting to send a message,\" he said.\n",
      "Chinese billionaire stripped of visa calls Australia 'a giant baby'\n",
      "Wider strains\n",
      "Increasingly, the Pacific -- a region where New Zealand has long been a significant player -- is shaping up to be a new battleground for influence.\n",
      "China has promised billions of dollars of aid and support in the region and, if it follows through, could overtake Australia as the biggest donor to the Pacific nations.\n",
      "China could overtake Australia as biggest donor to Pacific, if it pays up\n",
      "New Zealand has also been ramping up spending. Last year, the government announced it would boost aid in the region by 714 million New Zealand dollars ($484 million) as part of its \"Pacific Reset\" strategy -- a move commentators said was at least partly driven by China's growing influence in the area.\n",
      "\"Our eyes are wide open to New Zealand's decreasing influence in the Pacific and we are committed to resetting our approach to working with the Pacific,\" Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters said in June last year.\n",
      "Despite the numerous points of friction, Stephen Jacobi, the executive director of the New Zealand China Council, isn't panicking. Instead, Jacobi said, the biggest fear is that tiny New Zealand becomes irrelevant.\n",
      "\"The reality is we are a small country and the Chinese don't get up every day thinking about how they can do nice things for New Zealand,\" he said. \"That means we need to be careful in the way we do things -- but we are never going to agree on everything with China.\" Taiwan wants to buy advanced jets and tanks from the US In response, China's Defense Ministry said Beijing was \"firmly opposed to US arms sales to Taiwan and US military contact with Taiwan.\"\n",
      "\"The Taiwan issue belongs to China's internal affairs, concerns China's core interest and the national bond of the Chinese people -- it allows no outside interference,\" spokesman Wu Qian said.\n",

      "US Navy plane warned off by Chinese military 01:06\n",
      "'Aggressive approach'\n",
      "Cross-strait tensions have been on the rise in recent years, as Beijing attempts to pressure Taiwan over what it fears is growing support for independence on the self-ruled island.\n",
      "Taiwan has been de facto independent from mainland China since the end of the country's civil war in 1949 when the losing nationalist government fled to Taipei. China's Communist Party has always maintained that Taiwan is part of its territory and vowed to pursue reunification, vacillating between building economic and social ties with the island and threatening it militarily.\n",
      "In her New Year's address, Tsai called on Beijing to \"face the reality of the existence of the Republic of China,\" referring to the island by its official name. She also urged Beijing to \"respect the commitment of the 23 million people of Taiwan to freedom and democracy.\"\n",
      "The following day, Xi called Taiwan independence \"a dead end\" and encouraged the island to follow the \"one country, two systems\" model adopted in Hong Kong when it moved from British to Chinese control in 1997.\n",
      "Tsai said earlier this week that Taiwan \"absolutely will not accept the 'one country, two systems' model.\"\n",
      "She took a forceful tone Wednesday, saying Taipei would take an \"aggressive approach to counteract the Chinese government's infiltration of our society and economy, as well as their interference in our domestic affairs.\"\n",
      "\"They have continued to undermine our democratic institutions, heighten military tensions and degrade our international space. This has led to growing distrust by the people of Taiwan, posing an underlying challenge to the future of cross-strait relations,\" she said. \"China's actions have underscored the need for Taiwan to increase our self-defense and deterrence capabilities.\" US sails two ships through Taiwan Strait ahead of trade talks in Beijing The approximately 110-mile-wide strait, which separates the People's Republic of China and Taiwan, is seen as a potential geopolitical flashpoint should Beijing ever seek to take the island of Taiwan by force.\n",
      "Beijing continues to lay claim to Taiwan, a self-governed, democratic island that China views as a breakaway province. The two have been separated since the end of a bloody civil war in 1949.\n",
      "While the strait constitutes international waters, China is thought to be very sensitive about the presence of US military forces there.\n",
      "In an exclusive interview with CNN last month, Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen said the military threat posed by China was growing \"every day\" in line with a more assertive foreign policy under its President Xi Jinping.\n",
      "While the US does not formally recognize Taiwan as an independent country it does maintain close relations with the island, a relationship defined by the Taiwan Relations act which was signed into law by President Jimmy Carter in April of 1979.\n",
      "The act says that \"the United States will make available to Taiwan such defense articles and defense services in such quantity as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capabilities,\" and the US has sold Taiwan a series of arms packages over the years, sales that are strongly protested by Beijing.\n",
      "Trump administration officials have hinted that additional arms sales to Taiwan could soon take place.\n",
      "Peter Navarro wrote in an op-ed in the New York Times last week that, \"Taiwan may soon buy 108 Abrams tanks\" and other officials have said that Taiwan could soon announce plans to purchase F-16 fighter jets.\n",
      "Observers see both sets of military equipment as likely to anger Beijing.\n",
      "The transit also comes the day after the White House announced that US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin would travel to China in an effort to resolve a long running trade dispute.\n",
      "\"Principal-level meetings starting on March 28 to continue negotiations aimed at improving the trade relationship between the United States and China,\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement Saturday. Asian airlines named the cleanest in the world in Skytrax survey (CNN) — Ever wonder how clean the airline seat you're sitting in is as you travel? A new survey has dished the dirt on which carriers offer the most pristine experiences for fliers.\n",

      "Cleanliness is a real concern for air travelers, with airports and planes seen as potential breeding grounds for bacteria.\n",
      "In 2015, website Travelmath.com sent a microbiologist to take 26 samples from five US airports and four flights by two major carriers -- although it didn't specify which ones.\n",

      "Tested tray tables were found to have an average of 2,155 colony-forming units (CFUs) per square inch.\n",

      "share link What warmer oceans mean for the planet When water heats up, it takes up more space. That means as oceans warm, sea levels rise. The study says this effect alone could make sea levels rise 30cm (12 inches) by the end of the century.\n",
      "\"That doesn't sound like much, but there are many large cities around the world, much built on reclaimed land, that are not more than 30cm above sea level,\" says Stephen Simpson, associate professor in marine biology and global change at the University of Exeter, in the UK. \"Millions and millions of people would be displaced.\"\n",
      "But on top of that, warming oceans are causing polar ice sheets to melt faster, which will make sea levels rise even more.\n",
      "Read: 15 facts about sea level rise\n",
      "The combination of melting ice and expanding water could cause sea levels to rise by up to a meter by 2100. Hundreds of millions of people could be forced to leave their homes.\n",

      "Another problem for sea life is that increased flooding causes more nutrients to be washed into the sea. This leads to plankton blooms and ultimately causes some parts of the sea to be starved of oxygen, making it hard for fish to live there.\n",
      "Warm oceans hold less oxygen, which makes the problem worse. Simpson says some areas of Japan, Taiwan and the Baltic Sea are seeing dramatic die-offs of fish because of low oxygen.\n",
      "Food security\n",
      "Fish species respond to warmer oceans by migrating to cooler areas, says Simpson. But the waters in some parts of the world are getting too warm for any fish -- and that could lead to food shortages in those areas.\n",
      "\"There is a severe food security risk in the tropics,\" says Simpson. \"No species are already activated to temperatures warmer than the tropics, so you could see a real crash in food fish populations. And these are places where coastal nations often have no other protein in the diet other than the fish from coral reefs.\"\n",
      "Melting sea ice\n",
      "Warmer seas are causing sea ice to melt. Sea ice floats on the ocean surface, so when it melts it doesn't affect sea levels. But it means there's less sea ice to reflect heat from the sun back into space, which means the planet gets warmer.\n",

      "Read: Polar bears will struggle to survive if climate change continues\n",
      "\"The Inuit living in Canada, for example, is a culture based on sea ice,\" says Arnaud Czaja, a reader in physical oceanography at Imperial College London. \"They get their food by hunting seals and polar bears from sea ice, or fishing from sea ice. When the sea ice is disappearing that's not possible, so the whole culture is being lost.\"\n",

Exposure to infection in the womb increases risk of autism and depression, study says In total, they looked at the records of 1,791,520 children and, using hospitalization codes, identified those who'd been exposed to their mother's infection in utero.\n",
      "The study was published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry. The results, Adams Waldorf said, were \"very surprising.\"\n",
      "Taking prenatal vitamins early in pregnancy is associated with lower risk of autism, study says\n",
      "Children born to mothers with an infection during pregnancy had a 79% increased risk of an autism diagnosis and a 24% increased risk of a depression diagnosis as adults, the researchers found. They also saw \"an increased risk of suicide in those children that had been exposed to infections in utero,\" Adams Waldorf said, adding that this association made the depression findings \"much stronger.\"\n",
      "The increased risk level for autism and depression was detected regardless of whether fetal exposure was to a severe infection -- such as sepsis, flu, pneumonia, meningitis or encephalitis, chorioamnionitis (an infection of the placental tissues) or pyelonephritis (a severe kidney infection) -- or a urinary tract infection.\n",
      "No increased risk of bipolar disorder or psychosis, including schizophrenia, was seen among those exposed to infection during fetal development, the study showed.\n",
      "FDA approves ketamine-like nasal spray for depression\n",
      "\"We need more research into understanding the inflammation that occurs in the urinary tract infection and how it might impact the fetus,\" Adams Waldorf said. More research is also needed on areas of the fetal brain that are extremely vulnerable to damage from infection and inflammation.\n",
      "\"The hippocampus is a very vulnerable part of the brain that is targeted by Zika virus infection but may be vulnerable to other infections as well,\" she said, explaining that this brain region \"plays a key role in social and emotional functioning.\"\n",
      "Sensitive periods in brain development\n",
      "Margaret McCarthy, a neuroscientist and professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, said the study is \"astonishing\" in terms of both the number of subjects and the length of time. \"To my knowledge, this is the largest and most comprehensive study of in utero infections and the health outcomes for the offspring,\" said McCarthy, who had no role in the new research.\n",
      "The fact that both severe infection and urinary tract infection conferred the same level of risk \"highlights that there's something very subtle that can be very profound in brain development, and it probably has to do with sensitive periods in brain development that we don't understand yet,\" she said.\n",
      "One in 7 babies prenatally exposed to Zika has health problems, CDC says\n",
      "In her own research on sex differences and brain development, she found that a lot of immune system signaling \"sculpts\" the male brain during development. \"And we have speculated that this increases their risk for neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric disorders like ADHD, autism, et cetera.\" Yet, she added, studies have shown that both boosting inflammatory molecules (due to an illness or infection) or dampening them all the way down (by treating an illness or infection with certain medicines) may have deleterious effects on brain development.\n",
      "\"Brain development is really complicated, and things that we think are relatively benign sometimes aren't, because we still don't understand just a lot of the basic signaling molecules that are involved,\" she said.\n",
      "How fever in early pregnancy can cause birth defects\n",
      "Dr. Alan S. Brown, a professor of psychiatry and epidemiology at the Columbia University Medical Center, said in an email that \"overall, the investigators have done a commendable job.\" However, he also noted that the \"findings could also be influenced by treatment-seeking behaviors.\"\n",
      "A previous study from Taiwan showed that treatment for infection in the third trimester was related to autism risk, explained Brown, who was not involved in the new study.\n",

      "\"Starting in the 1990s, we demonstrated that prenatal exposure to several pathogens including rubella, influenza and toxoplasmosis are related to risk of schizophrenia,\" he said of his own research. \"In more recent work, we showed that prenatal influenza was related to bipolar disorder.\"\n",
      "Brown believes the new study provides more evidence for \"relationships between prenatal infection and autism and opens up a potential new avenue of exploration regarding prenatal infection and depression.\"\n",
      "McCarthy said, \"I don't think pregnant women should panic. Try to avoid any kind of infection; avoid it if you can, and if you do have to treat it, treat it judiciously.\" China's military is going from strength to strength under Xi Jinping While the Chinese military may be one of the world's best-funded armed forces, its budget still pales in comparison to United States. In December, US President Donald Trump agreed to increase the defense budget funding to $750 billion in 2019.\n",
      "The US Navy still dominates the world's oceans too, far outpacing China in its logistical capabilities and international reach.\n",
      "But Beijing is rapidly gaining ground on its American rival, by churning out naval vessels and making technological advances, according to Andrew Erickson, professor of strategy at the US Naval War College's China Maritime Studies Institute.\n",

      "Beijing's air force is now the largest in Asia and the third largest in the world, according to the US Defense Department, and is closing the gap with the US \"across a spectrum of capabilities.\"\n",
      "At the same time, Xi has also begun a reorganization of military personnel, stressing quality and effectiveness over quantity of staff. In 2017, Xi streamlined the powerful Central Military Commission, which he leads, reducing the number of members and solidifying his control.\n",
      "Multiple former generals have been disciplined or imprisoned for corruption in an attempt to professionalize the armed services.\n",
      "Aircraft carriers and corvettes\n",
      "While the military strengths of the US and China are often compared, the two governments ostensibly have built their armed forces to serve different goals.\n",
      "Washington says it aims to maintain a worldwide reach for its military to protect allies and American interests internationally.\n",
      "Beijing claims its interests lie closer to home.\n",
      "US warships again challenge Beijing's claims in South China Sea\n",
      "Zhang Yesui, the National People's Congress spokesman, on Monday afternoon told reporters: \"China's limited defense spending, which is for safeguarding its national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity, poses no threat to any other country.\n",
      "\"Whether a country is a military threat to others or not is not determined by its increase in defense expenditure, but by the foreign and national defense policies it adopts.\"\n",
      "The major scenarios that China's military cares about could be called \"home games, rather than away games,\" Erickson said.\n",
      "The Chinese government has built a navy and armed forces designed to protect the country and exert its influence in the surrounding region, especially the East and South China seas.\n",
      "The proof is in the military hardware that the two countries have focused on.\n",
      "While the US has a huge fleet of 12 nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, China has barely one conventionally powered carrier operating, with another in the wings. The Type 001A, the country's first homegrown aircraft carrier, was launched in 2018 but still has not joined the fleet.\n",
      "Xi Jinping's global dreams hit a wall amid growing backlash against China\n",
      "Beijing has, however, rapidly produced Jiangdao-class corvettes, a small warship generally best suited to fighting close to home. A US Department of Defense report in 2018 said this move was designed with an eye to \"littoral\" combat, or fighting close to China's shores.\n",
      "Backing this up is China's rapid production of frigates, another small type of warship, and the arming and expansion of the country's coast guard.\n",
      "This makes sense given the Chinese government's focus on controlling the South China Sea, where it has been building militarized artificial islands and holding regular drills in the sea.\n",
      "But all this doesn't prevent the Chinese military from having growing its fleet to extend its global influence. The PLA opened its first international base in Djibouti in July 2017. A third aircraft carrier is reportedly under construction, featuring advanced launching capabilities.\n",
      "\"They're building power projection capabilities which will give them greater ability to project presence and power (into) the Pacific and the Indian Ocean,\" said Malcolm Davis, senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\n",
      "Doubts\n",
      "China has undoubtedly made rapid progress. Some experts, however, doubt its ability to fight as a coherent force or the experience of its troops.\n",
      "There are also doubts around the effectiveness of some of the PLA's new technologies. Military analyst Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain, has cast doubt on some of the advances allegedly made by the Chinese military, including claims that it has developed a ship-killer ballistic missile.\n",
      "Is China's latest weaponry science fiction or battle ready?\n",
      "Such a missile could in theory be based well out-of-range of US naval strike forces while putting Washington's biggest assets, its aircraft carriers, in range.\n",
      "But Schuster says no military has ever successfully developed an anti-ship ballistic missile and China had shown no evidence of actually being able to hit a moving target in the ocean.\n",
      "There is also discontent within the Chinese military over the treatment of veterans. The decision in 2015 to lay off 300,000 soldiers over three years to streamline the armed forces led to repeated mass protests in a number of cities after the government failed to pay all their pensions in full.\n",
      "But Davis said the military prospects of the United States are looking increasingly troubled, thanks to rising maintenance costs and an aging fleet, which might give Beijing the chance it needs to catch up.\n",
      "\"It's not clear the traditional advantage in military technology for the US is going to remain intact,\" he said.\n",
      "\"Getting that balance between sustainment and modernization right is a real challenge for the US as their forces get older and older, whereas the Chinese are steamrolling ahead.\" The 27-year-old who instigated a referendum in famously apolitical Japan Last Sunday, 52% of voters in Okinawa -- which has a population of 1.4 million -- turned out to cast their ballots. Just over 70% of them opposed plans to relocate Futenma Air Station from a densely populated area to a remote location with endangered coral reefs.\n",
      "Instead, they say the base should be moved off the island altogether.\n",
      "The decision was not legally binding and Tokyo plans to press ahead with the relocation. But for Motoyama, the vote was about much, much more.\n",
      "\"The base issue is tied to all of our other problems but we don't want to just limit the discussion to the US military presence,\" he said.\n",
      "\"We need to open up a dialogue about Okinawa's future.\"\n",

      "For the most part, he says, the bases blended into the landscape.\n",
      "\"They'd been there before I was born so I coexisted alongside them,\" Motoyama said. \"But I remember kicking a soccer ball into one by mistake when I was around six years old. I couldn't go in to retrieve it -- and it only hit me why when I grew up.\"\n",
      "Motoyama left Okinawa to study in Tokyo when he was 18. There, he became more politicized.\n",
      "\"In Japan, many young people feel like they can't change the political system,\" he said. \"But I think that young people in Okinawa are starting to feel like if people do something then things can change.\"\n",

      "In February 2018, Motoyama established a citizens' group dedicated to solving the problems afflicting the prefecture. He toured many of Okinawa's 55 islands to learn about the issues people faced -- and, over the course of two months, gathered more than 92,000 signatures calling for the referendum.\n",
      "The vote fnally went ahead on February 24.\n",

      "Being the public face of a political movement is not an easy task, of course.\n",
      "In January, Motoyama staged a five-day hunger strike after his home region of Ginowan and four other Okinawan municipalities opted out of the referendum because their assemblies refused to fund it. He had read about how Okinawans used hunger strikes as a protest tactic while under US rule.\n",
      "\"I carried out my hunger strike in front of the mayoral office in Ginowan,\" Motoyama said.\n",
      "In the end, Ginowan and the other municipalities took part.\n",
      "New and encouraging era\n",
      "Motoyama's referendum helped galvanize political enthusiasm among Okinawa's youth, according to Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University.\n",
      "\"The activism of the Okinawans has long been known, but this time the youths took the lead -- and that is new and encouraging,\" Nakano said.\n",

      "Troubled past\n",
      "For Motoyama, the referendum was a way of engaging all residents in Okinawa's political and social issues.\n",
      "\"The prefecture has long been suffering from the burden of having to shoulder a grossly disproportionate share of the US bases, on top of its tragic history during World War II and after,\" Nakano added.\n",
      "Okinawa suffered one of the war's bloodiest battles and lost a third of its population.\n",

      "Low education, high child poverty and high school dropout rates blight progress.\n",
      "In the immediate aftermath of World War II, half the Okinawan economy's revenue was base-related. By 2013, that had fallen to 5.1%.\n",
      "But with its renowned white beaches and clear blue seas, many are looking forward to new opportunities.\n",
      "In 2017, Okinawa topped Hawaii as a tourist destination, with 9.6 million visitors reportedly flocking to the prefecture.\n",
      "\"The experiences of World War II that our grandparents lived through feels distant to us as we didn't experience it,\" Motoyama said.\n",
      "\"We need to think of a way of inheriting this collective memory while moving forward.\" China lost 161 billionaires because its stock markets tanked Among the biggest losers in China were Ma Huateng, the CEO of internet giant Tencent (TCEHY), whose fortune slumped 19% to $38 billion. Shares in Tencent were hit hard by a freeze in Chinese approvals for many of its money-making games.\n",
      "Dalian Wanda Group's Wang Jianlin, once China's richest man, suffered a 37% plunge in net worth to $17 billion. Wang, who once boasted about his sprawling global business empire, has been more focused in recent years on selling off assets from his real estate and entertainment conglomerate.\n",
      "Jack Ma and others get richer\n",
      "Some Chinese billionaires thrived amid the turmoil, though.\n",
      "Jack Ma, founder of e-commerce company Alibaba (BABA), enjoyed a rise of more than 20% in his wealth to $39 billion, making him China's richest man. Ma's fortune rose last year thanks to a sharp increase in the value of Alibaba's online payments affiliate, Ant Financial.\n",
      "He is still a long way behind the world's richest man, Jeff Bezos. Hurun pegs the Amazon (AMZN) chief's net worth at $147 billion.\n",
      "A series of big Chinese IPOs also catapulted new names into the ranks of the super-rich.\n",
      "Zhang Yong is now the richest restaurant owner in the world after his Chinese hot pot chain, Haidilao, went public in Hong Kong last year. Zhang is worth an estimated $8.8 billion.\n",
      "China's ByteDance is taking the social media world by storm\n",
      "Another new entrant is Zhang Yiming, the founder of internet startup ByteDance. The company, which is behind a bunch of popular social media apps like TikTok, is now reportedly valued at about $75 billion.\n",
      "\"Despite the slowdown in the Chinese economy, there is significant innovation going on, shown by China having more new faces than any other country in the world,\" said Rupert Hoogewerf, Hurun Report's chairman.\n",

      "Shrewd tactician\n",
      "Tsai may not be a natural politician, but she didn't become Taiwan's first female president by accident.\n",
      "A shrewd tactician, she spent 15 years as a trade negotiator before leading Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, which handles issues with mainland China. Eventually, she became the head of the Democratic Progressive Party.\n",
      "Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen will run for re-election in 2020\n",
      "A failed bid for the presidency in 2012 did not dissuade her, and she rode to power on a wave of anti-China sentiment in 2016.\n",
      "Although Taiwan has been self-governed since 1949, Beijing still views the island as a rebel province and is increasing pressure to reunite.\n",
      "\"If it's Taiwan today ... who's next? Any country in the region -- if it no longer wants to submit to the will of China, they would face similar military threats,\" Tsai said.\n",
      "Given the relative unpopularity of her domestic policies, she's hoping her hard China stance can be an election-winning issue.\n",
      "Tsai has certainly been more explicit in her anti-Beijing sentiment of late. In January, she declared China needed to respect Taiwan's independence and she would protect \"the free and democratic life of our 23 million people.\"\n",
      "\"If a vibrant democracy that champions universal values and follows international rules were destroyed by China, it would be a huge setback for global democracy,\" she told CNN. IRS analyst charged in leak of Michael Cohen's bank records In May 2018, Fry, who works in the IRS' San Francisco office, accessed and downloaded five suspicious activity reports connected to Cohen, according to the complaint. Those reports contained information about a bank account opened for Essential Consultants LLC, a shell company Cohen created, and detailed \"numerous suspicious payments\" from a company linked to a Russian oligarch, pharmaceutical giant Novartis, AT&T -- which owns CNN -- and others.\n",
      "Another report contained information that matches the $130,000 that Cohen paid to Avenatti's client, adult-film actress Stormy Daniels, to silence her allegations of an affair with Trump. (Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels.)\n",
      "Yet another \"discussed possible fraudulent and illegal financial transactions\" by Cohen in 2016 and 2017 in Singapore, Hungary, Malaysia, Canada, Taiwan, Kenya and Israel, according to the complaint.\n",
      "About 20 minutes after Fry began accessing the reports, he placed two calls to a number associated with Avenatti, the complaint says, and shortly thereafter, Fry attempted to access two other Cohen-connected suspicious activity reports that the system told him were \"unavailable.\"\n",
      "According to the complaint, several days later Fry again called Avenatti, and Avenatti subsequently \"used his public Twitter account to circulate a dossier releasing confidential banking information related to Cohen and his company Essential Consultants.\"\n",
      "Fry also called a reporter at The New Yorker, who isn't named in the complaint but, based on the description of the reporter's work, appears to be Ronan Farrow. After weeks of WhatsApp messages between Fry and the reporter, Farrow published a story that quoted a \"law enforcement officer\" responsible for the leak of Cohen's banking information as saying he did so because he became alarmed that he was unable to find two of the reports on Cohen.\n",
      "In fact, the complaint says, the suspicious activity reports that were not available to Fry had been given \"restricted access\" in the system \"because they were related to a sensitive open investigation.\" At the time, Cohen was being investigated by the Manhattan US attorney's office, which later charged him with eight counts, to which he pleaded guilty.\n",
      "In recent weeks, Fry's hearing date was pushed back several times as federal prosecutors were engaged with Fry's attorney on plea negotiations, according to a person familiar with the talks. As of Thursday, Fry declined to plead to felony charges in exchange for probation.\n",
      "As a result, prosecutors will seek an indictment of Fry on February 28, this person said, and are expected to seek two additional charges, misuse of a Social Security number and misuse of a government computer.\n",
      "Fry is scheduled for a preliminary hearing or arraignment on March 13, according to the US attorney's office. The UK would be 'irresponsible' to let Huawei into 5G, think tank warns Zeng Rong, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, said in a statement that \"discrediting a company without any concrete evidence misleads the public, violates rules of commerce and damages business confidence.\"\n",
      "\"The right approach is to be rational towards foreign companies and support fair competition,\" she added.\n",
      "The report's release comes days after the Financial Times reported that the UK's National Cyber Security Centre had concluded the risks of using Huawei equipment in 5G networks could be managed.\n",
      "The UK government, a key US ally on intelligence and security, is expected to decide this spring which suppliers can provide technology for 5G networks. If it chooses to allow the use of Huawei gear, it could seriously undermine the US campaign against the company and influence other governments that are weighing how to handle the issue.\n",
      "The UK Department of Culture, Media and Sport said in a statement earlier this week that it was \"looking at a range of options\" and that \"no decisions have been taken.\"\n",
      "'A rigorous, ruthless advancement of China's interests'\n",
      "The RUSI report — written by former diplomat Charles Parton, who spent 22 years working in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan — warned that the UK government needed to stay alert for interference from the Chinese government across a range of fronts, including politics and research.\n",
      "Britain is a particularly appealing target for interference as a close US ally with a large Chinese ethnic community and an open, advanced economy, Parton said.\n",
      "Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei: The US 'cannot crush us'\n",
      "\"Beijing's interference is not aimed at subverting the West, but represents a rigorous, ruthless advancement of China's interests and values at the expense of those of the West,\" he wrote.\n",
      "Australia and New Zealand have already blocked mobile carriers from using equipment from Huawei, the world's biggest maker of telecommunications equipment, over security concerns.\n",
      "The United States has made it clear that any country that uses Huawei will find its opportunities to work with Washington limited. In a speech in Munich on Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence described the company as a \"threat.\"\n",
      "\"Chinese law requires them to provide Beijing's vast security apparatus with access to any data that touches their networks or equipment,\" Pence said.\n",
      "The RUSI report reached a similar conclusion, saying that although Huawei may be a private company, China's national security laws required cooperation with authorities when requested.\n",
      "\"Huawei's Chinese staff have no choice but to accede to requests from Chinese government departments,\" the report said.\n",
      "The Chinese government has denied it would demand access to Huawei's technology for spying, and the company has said it would refuse such a request.\n",
      "Intelligence ties at risk\n",
      "If the UK government approves the use of Huawei technology in 5G networks, close allies might be less inclined to work with it in the future, the RUSI report warned.\n",
      "America's fight with Huawei is messing with the world's 5G plans\n",
      "Britain is part of the intelligence-sharing group known as Five Eyes, which also includes the United States, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.\n",
      "\"The maintenance of a 'Five Eyes standard' of cyber security in telecommunications is a vital strategic and security interest, the loss of which would go far beyond a reduction in intelligence reports exchanged and might lead to the UK being excluded from work on developing future technologies for intelligence collection,\" the report said.\n",
      "It also advised devoting more resources to protecting British universities, where technology of interest to Beijing may be under development.\n",
      "\"Ultimately, the United Kingdom's goal must be genuine reciprocity and an equal, mature and comprehensive relationship with China,\" the report said.

      "As the first woman to be elected Taiwan's leader, Tsai was carried into office on a swell of anti-Beijing sentiment following attempts by the Kuomintang party to move closer to China.\n",
      "But her popularity has fallen steadily in the face of domestic opposition to her policies and a struggling Taiwan economy battling to keep up with the mainland.\n",
      "In November Tsai's DPP suffered a bruising defeat in local elections, losing by as much as 10% across the island. Tsai said the 2018 result was due to what she called a \"challenging\" domestic reform agenda.\n",
      "\"The people don't feel the result of the reform so much when you've just started,\" she said.\n",

      "China's Xi is unlikely to welcome a second term for Tsai. Since she came to power, the Chinese government has increasingly tried to exert pressure on Taiwan, known officially as the Republic of China, to unify with the People's Republic of China, as the mainland is officially known.\n",
      "In January, Xi Jinping called for the \"peaceful reunification\" of China and Taiwan in a landmark speech, warning that Taiwan independence was a \"dead end.\"\n",
      "\"We make no promise to renounce the use of force,\" the Chinese leader said.\n",
      "Tsai said President Xi's January speech had caused concern within Taiwan. She said the island refused to become another Hong Kong or Macau -- both semi-autonomous cities under Beijing's rule.\n",
      "\"(The speech) has alarmed us that Taiwan's independent existence may be changed,\" she said.\n",
      "But Tsai said the threats and intimidation out of Beijing are counter-productive to Xi's goals, and serve only to push the island further away from the Communist Party and strengthen support for democracy.\n",
      "\"China may feel such (pressure) would create a sense of failure for people in Taiwan and deal a blow on our morale. But every such move has only further upset and alienated Taiwanese people,\" she said.\n",

      "In January Taiwan held military drills intended to ready its troops in the event of an invasion from the mainland. Photos showed dramatic images of helicopters and artillery launchers conducting live-fire exercises.\n",
      "Tsai said she was strengthening Taiwan's military capabilities in the face of China's rapid modernization. She said Taiwan was \"on alert 24/7\" for the first sign of a Chinese strike.\n",
      "\"What we are expecting is, after withstanding the first wave of Chinese attacks ourselves, the rest of the world would stand up to exert strong pressure on China,\" she said.\n",
      "Taiwan holds military drills to halt invasion amid rising China tensions\n",
      "While Tsai did not say it specifically, it's likely any pressure exerted on China will come from Washington. For years, the United States has provided a tacit guarantee of protection from Beijing.\n",
      "Under Trump, the relationship between Washington and Taipei has grown closer with expanded weapons sales and greater vocal support from US politicians.\n",
      "In 2018 Trump signed into law the Taiwan Travel Act, encouraging \"visits between officials of the United States and Taiwan at all levels.\" Months later, the US approved the sale of submarine parts to Taiwan.\n",
      "In June, the US opened a new, $255 million de facto embassy on the island, known as the American Institute in Taiwan.\n",
      "Many leaders around the world have criticized President Trump for focusing on domestic US interests at the expense of the international community but Tsai said she didn't see it that way.\n",
      "\"Any president has to take multiple factors into consideration when making decisions, especially domestic decisions. That's why President Trump has been emphasizing 'America First',\" she said.\n",
      "Trump broke decades of protocol and took a brief congratulatory call from Tsai upon his election in 2016, but the two have yet to meet in person.\n",
      "There is an outside chance that could change this year. A group of US lawmakers, led by Republican senator Cory Gardner, have asked US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to invite Tsai to address a joint meeting of the US Congress.\n",
      "But Tsai declined to say whether she would accept an invitation to speak, a move that should it go ahead would be sure to infuriate China.\n",
      "\"It's not a simple question of invitation and acceptance,\" said Tsai. \"Whether or not to go deliver a speech in Washington would depend on whether such a move benefits Taiwan, our relations with the US and regional stability.\"\n",
      "The US has been careful, at least publicly, to adhere to a so-called \"one China\" policy, acknowledging Beijing's assertion that Taiwan is part of China, as well as the People's Republic's status as the sole legitimate government of China. It is this policy that sees the US base its embassy in Beijing, but not in Taipei.\n",
      "But Washington has also maintained deliberate ambiguity on the status of Taiwan, only encouraging both sides to engage in dialogue to settle their long-running disputes.\n",

      "Caught in the middle\n",
      "Trump's foreign policy hasn't all been good news for Taiwan. As the US President tries to drive down the trade deficit, Taiwan has become caught in the middle of a US-China trade war.\n",
      "\"There's a lot of trade and economic flow between Taiwan and the US as well as investment and trade with China,\" said Tsai. \"We have to make sure that we can lessen the impact of any kind of uncertainty on Taiwan's economy.\"\n",
      "Tsai said with no clear end to the trade dispute in sight, she was taking actions to protect Taiwan, including government spending to stimulate domestic consumption and investment.\n",
      "\"So that the growth of our economy can be driven by domestic demand instead of an over reliance on exports,\" said Tsai.\n",
      "But while the trade war may cause difficulties for Taiwan's exports, it could present an opportunity for the island's tech sector.\n",
      "The US is currently ramping up its opposition to Chinese technology, in particular the telecoms giant Huawei, over concerns of potential security threats.\n",
      "Both US Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have warned countries that using Chinese 5G mobile phone technology will make it more difficult to work with the US.\n",
      "Tsai said that unlike Chinese products, other countries had no such security concerns about Taiwan's technology. \"Taiwan is a very secure location for the manufacture of such products,\" she said.\n",
      "\"We manufacture and design a lot of high-tech products such as semiconductors and we rank in the front in terms of worldwide production.\"\n",
      "Taiwan faces down China\n",
      "Throughout her interview, Tsai painted the picture of Taiwan as an underdog facing down the growing might of Beijing, the first line of defense for the liberal, democratic world order.\n",
      "\"If a vibrant democracy that champions universal values and follows international rules were destroyed by China, it would be a huge setback for global democracy,\" she said.\n",

      "In reply, the Taiwan military posted dramatic footage of soldiers, tanks and explosions, followed by a simple message -- \"On standby 24/7.\"\n",

But with shrinking trade comes exclusivity: While a qipao in the 1920s could cost as little as one Hong Kong Dollar (13 cents), Kan's dresses today sell for up to 20,000 Hong Kong dollars ($2,549).\n",
      "\"Every qipao is unique,\" he said. \"Tailors need to be very detail-minded. I will give people suggestions if their 'dream qipao' is too ugly.\"\n",

      "Originally from Vietnam, Chen Kau has been a letter writer in Hong Kong for nearly 40 years. Credit: Gary Jones\n",
      "Letter writing was a profitable business in Hong Kong during the 1950s and 1960s, when the city's literacy rate was as low as 60%. Professional letter writers would help people contact relatives overseas, write legal documents and fill out forms or applications.\n",
      "But with the introduction of compulsory education, and the rapid evolution of technology, demand has fallen. There may now be fewer than 10 professional letter writers in the city.\n",
      "One of them, Chen Kau, has a handful of regular customers who he helps with tax forms, welfare applications or visas. Most days, he has none at all, so sits reading the newspaper or chatting.\n",
      "\"The development of technology like smartphones and computers is the biggest enemy of our industry,\" he said. \"But at the same time, it is essential for a city or any society to improve with time. There must be some jobs that are replaced or even eliminated.\"\n",

      "Stencil makers like Wu Ding Keung begin by drawing the Chinese characters onto thin iron sheets, before carefully cutting them out with a hammer and chisel. Credit: Gary Jones\n",
      "Stencil making is among Hong Kong's oldest trades and was once a thriving industry. The delicate process requires a sharp eye, a steady hand and expert calligraphy skills.\n",
      "Craftsmen first draw the Chinese characters onto thin iron sheets, then very carefully cut them out with a hammer and chisel. These hand-cut stencils were used for advertising, wall notices and shop signs, though they've have been largely replaced by digital or laser-cut alternatives.\n",
      "Wu Ding Keung is among Hong Kong's last stencil makers. Stooped over a small table with only a hammer and bag of chisels, the 82-year-old can go for days without seeing a single customer, but he continues working to keep himself busy.\n",
      "\"I've forgotten how long I've been working here, but I know I started before the handover of Hong Kong,\" Wu said.\n",
      "\"I once helped a couple make a stencil for their wedding party. I liked that.\"\n",
      "Lo Sai Keung, photofinisher\n",
      "Lo Sai Keung's store, Sunrise Professional Photofinishing, is packed with new and second-hand cameras, some of which date as far back as the 1930s. Credit: Gary Jones\n",
      "In the 1990s, there were about 1,000 shops developing film around Hong Kong. Now, there are fewer than 50. Most shop owners responded to the demise of film by switching to digital cameras, lenses, photo processing or printing, but a few hardy shops still sell film and analog camera equipment to passionate enthusiasts.\n",
      "Lo Sai Keung's shop, Sunrise Professional Photofinishing, is packed with new and second-hand cameras dating as far back as the 1930s.\n",
      "Nowadays, he develops about 20 to 30 rolls of film a day; however, in the 1970s and 1980s, he would process about 200 a day. Most of Lo's customers are young, curious photography students looking to try their hand at analog photography.\n",
      "\"Hong Kong people love selfies,\" he said. \"You can still do them with film cameras although it's harder and you would probably need a mirror.\"\n",

      "Read more Maria Ressa's arrest spells more trouble for press freedom in increasingly illiberal Asia Rappler's reputation\n",
      "Despite frequent verbal attacks and obstacles raised by the Duterte administration, Rappler is admired for its fearless reporting on the country's deadly war on drugs and scores of other issues with the current government, including its treatment of opposition politicians.\n",
      "In the light of its uncompromising record, Ressa's arrest has been widely seen by human rights and journalist activist groups as a warning shot to the press.\n",
      "\"Rappler is a giant here, their body of work is really something,\" says Carlos Conde, a Human Rights Watch researcher based in Manila.\n",
      "\"Trying to undermine or to sideline Maria Ressa or Rappler is a huge assault on the press in the Philippines,\" Conde says.\n",

He is now an academic in his native Australia and founding director of the Alliance for Journalists' Freedom.\n",
      "\"You can't look at this in isolation, think of it in terms of what it means to the entire media in the Philippines -- if you question the administration, you can expect harassment, intimidation, and arrest.\"\n",
      "Why Maria Ressa's arrest should unnerve everyone\n",
      "Conde agrees, and says the message is stark. \"The message is: 'Don't mess with us. We're determined to make our vision for this country a reality.'\"\n",

The free press is the best way people have of informing what governments are doing. Otherwise all you get is propaganda.\"\n",
      "What is Rappler, the website targeted by the Philippine government?\n",
      "Shawn Crispin, Senior Southeast Asia Representative at the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), worries that governments elsewhere could see the international community's pallid response to Duterte's attacks on Rappler as license to launch their own crackdowns on critical voices.\n",
      "\"Rappler is widely seen as the epitome of a free press, a news organization that was digging in to what is seen as an abusive government,\" he says. \"When the government fights back, how is the world going to respond?\"\n",
      "\"If the wider world's response turns out to be limp, maybe other regions will think they (too) can crack down on journalists. When a government goes after a news organization and gets away with it, it sends a signal across the board,\" he adds.\n",

      "US President Donald Trump's invective against the press is never far from the minds of press freedom advocates in Asia.\n",

      "Asia's strongmen follow Trump's lead on fake news\n",
      "\"When you see people like [Trump] throw out those principles in his public statements, describing press as the 'enemy of the people,' it absolutely gives license to everyone else,\" says Greste. \"His rhetoric has a very significant impact.\"\n",
      "Indeed, while parroting terms like \"fake news,\" authoritarians in the region also appear to have copied Trump's actions. Much like CNN White House reporter Jim Acosta's brief White House ban, Ressa and her colleague Pia Ranada have had their access to the Presidential Palace rescinded, severely hampering their reporting abilities.\n",

The maximum duration of stay in India under the e-medical visa is a longer duration of six months,\" Alphons said.\n",
      "Still, it's important to be cautious when it comes to predictions, said Johanna Hanefeld, an associate professor of health policy and systems at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n",
      "\"One of the challenges is that the figures cited are based on the private sector. It's private individuals paying private providers. Any type of figure tends to be relatively speculative. The initial wave of predictions was business analysis and research and was based on the thinking that people go on cost and quality alone. And essentially being a world with disappearing borders, this was an area of growth,\" Hanefeld said.\n",
      "\"In the last five years, these predictions have been down scaled because health is a difficult issue, and people make decisions based on a number of reasons such as culture, proximity or perception of care. These are not rational decisions based purely on economics.\"\n",

      "Mauritius offers medical care in the midst of pleasure\n",
      "Globally, around 14 million to 16 million patients traveled outside their home countries to seek treatment in 2017, according to Patients Beyond Borders, a medical travel advocacy group for consumers. The global medical tourism market is estimated to be around $45.5 billion to $72 billion.\n",
      "Other leading destinations include Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Turkey and the United States.\n",
      "There are challenges for the global industry and consumers too, especially quality and continuity of care.\n",
      "\"There is no quality assurance between countries,\" Hanefeld said. \"So if something goes wrong, there is no way for legal redress, whether there's malpractice or serious complications following a procedure. So I think this puts people off. It's all private-sector practice. There's no international body or quality assurance.\"\n",
      "Still, for many, cost savings can be a major draw. Using American health care costs as a benchmark, Patients Without Borders estimates savings ranging from 40% to 90%, depending on the country. In Taiwan, Thailand, Mexico and Turkey patients can save 40% to 65% on procedures and treatments.

Head to this Taiwan temple for a meeting with the 'Love God' Taipei, Taiwan (CNN) — These days, it's all about swiping right to find a partner. But some Taiwan residents have another method for finding romance besides Tinder -- they call on the god of marriage and love.\n",
      "According to Chinese mythology, the Love God, or Yue Lao, is in possession of a \"book of marriages,\" and can find and bind you to the one you're meant to be with, with a red string.\n",
      "The story goes that during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD), a man asked the Love God to show him his future wife. But he didn't believe the Love God and had the girl attacked. But in the future, when he actually met his wife, she had a scar from that same attack.\n",
      "Taking this somewhat gruesome story to heart, many started believing in the Love God -- also referred to as \"The Matchmaker\" or \"The Old Man under the Moon\" -- starting in the Qing Dynasty (1644 to 1912), says associate professor Isaac Yue of the University of Hong Kong.\n",
      "Today, believers continue to pray at statues of his likeness throughout Asia. And while there are larger, more colorful, even blingier, Love God sculptures in the region, the one in Taipei's Xia Hai City God Temple is the most popular.\n",

      "But in her own New Year's address, Tsai told Beijing to \"face the reality of the existence of the Republic of China,\" the official name for Taiwan.\n",
      "\"Respect the commitment of the 23 million people of Taiwan to freedom and democracy,\" she said.\n",
      "Domestic issues\n",
      "Despite the strained ties, Tsai said cross-strait relations weren't a key factor in her party's setback at last year's elections.\n",
      "Tsai said she blamed her party's bruising defeat on what she calls a difficult reform agenda she has pushed since taking office.\n",
      "Her efforts to promote pension reform and push for equal rights for the island's LGBT community have become divisive issues in Taiwan, fueling protests across the island.\n",
      "In Taiwan, the DPP's loss is China's gain and a setback for the US\n",
      "\"You get attacks, you get criticism, the people don't feel the result of the reform so much when you've just started,\" Tsai said.\n",
      "Tsai will face a difficult re-election bid and could be forced to fend off challengers both in her own party and the Kuomintang (KMT), the main opposition party that traditionally favors closer relations with mainland China.\n",
      "Some polls have Tsai down as much as 30% against potential Kuomintang presidential nominee Eric Chu, who she defeated in 2016.\n",
      "Asked if there was anything she regretted from her first term in office, Tsai said she felt she had spent too little time talking with voters in her first two years in power.\n",
      "\"I spent too much time in managing the government affairs and I spent a lot of time making foreign visits to our diplomatic allies,\" she said. \"Many people thought I was a bit detached from them.\" Fortune tellers, letter writers and the last of Hong Kong's traditional trades Written by Lindsay Varty\n",
      "Lindsay Varty is a Hong Kong-based journalist and professional rugby player. The following is an edited excerpt from her book \"Sunset Survivors,\" accompanied by photos by Gary Jones.\n",
      "From fortune tellers to professional letter writers, many of Hong Kong's street-savvy, traditional entrepreneurs have devoted their entire lives to ancient and increasingly forgotten practices.\n",
      "These tenacious tradesmen and women -- however clandestine against the city's frantic urban backdrop -- are essential ingredients in Hong Kong's cultural identity.\n",
      "But with almost no willing successors, skyrocketing rents and little chance of competing with larger companies, simply surviving has proven almost impossible. Along with photographer Gary Jones, I captured a glimpse of the hardy few who have battled the odds and continue to run their businesses today.\n",

      "Mak Ping Lam learned the art of seal-making from his brother-in-law, and has since passed on his trade to his son, who works with him. Credit: Gary Jones\n",
      "Despite having been in the seal-making business for half a century, Mak Ping Lam keeps his tools simple: a few rusty knives, a small wooden vice, one scrap of sandpaper and the bottom half of a soda can, which he uses as an ink tray.\n",
      "Chinese seals, or 'chops,' were used as a form of identification for legal papers, bank transfers and documents requiring authorship. In mainland China and Taiwan, they are still used on checks in lieu of a signature, though not in Hong Kong.\n",
      "To make a seal, Mak drafts a 2-square-centimeter (0.6-square-inch) design, and draws a mirror image of it onto the base of the seal. Only then can he begin to etch it into stone.\n",
      "\"Some fortune tellers tell people to come here, make a chop to put on their desk and they will get good luck,\" he said. \"I don't know if it works or not.\"\n",

      "Au-yeung Ping-chi hand-makes paper effigies, which are burned as offerings to the deceased. Credit: Gary Jones\n",
      "Burning paper effigies as offerings to the deceased is a common religious practice in Hong Kong. Artists carefully bend thin strips of bamboo into various shapes, before coating them with joss paper and paint.\n",
      "For ten hours every day, effigy maker Au-yeung Ping-chi hand-makes some of the most detailed and often bizarre paper designs found in Hong Kong. From food, clothes and houses, to laptops and even full-sized massage chairs, he produces replicas of items that customers hope will join their loved ones in the afterlife.\n",
      "Over the years, Au-yeung has seen people's requests change, from simpler pleasures like shoes to more modern items, like Nintendo Gameboys.\n",
      "\"People in the past were simpler -- they didn't need much even when they were alive,\" he said.\n",
      "\"When I die, I would like some cars, houses and a hi-fi system ... A super deluxe seven-foot-long Mercedes-Benz and Porsche will do.\"\n",

      "The Luk brothers are sons of the late Luk Bing, who established Bing Kee Copperware in the 1940s. The store still produces copper items for restaurants, homes, tea shops and hotels. Credit: Gary Jones\n",
      "In the 1950s and 1960s, most Hong Kong families used copperware pots, pans and kettles. But the material was gradually replaced by stainless steel, which is easier to clean and less reactive to acid.\n",
      "Chinese herbal tea shops still choose copper over steel -- as do some chefs, because of its ability to heat quickly and evenly. However, very few places in Hong Kong continue to make these products.\n",
      "The Luk brothers learned the trade from their father, and they still work in the family's old shop. It takes a full day to finish one pot, which they sell for about 700 Hong Kong dollars ($89). Their shop is brimming with handcrafted kitchenware, urns, door knockers and other trinkets.\n",
      "\"I cook with copper utensils,\" older brother Luk Shu Choi said. \"But I also like to use an electronic rice cooker as it's really convenient. You can't just stick with the old things; we also have to follow trends and the development of the world.\"\n",

      "Chan Lok Choi has been making birdcages since he was just 13 years old. Taught by his uncle and another famous cage-maker, Chan's craft sees him bending bamboo rods into place, carving patterns or scriptures onto them and then painting the cage.\n",
      "Taking caged birds to parks in the morning was once a common practice in Hong Kong. You would often see the cages hanging from trees, while owners read newspapers or played mahjong.\n",
      "A handful of these bird-lovers can still be found today, either in the city's parks or at the Yuen Po Bird Market, where Chan's shop is located. But criticism from animal rights groups and the arrival of avian flu in 2012 -- which led to caged birds being banned on public transport -- have dampened this tradition.\n",
      "\"I would love to have an apprentice,\" Chan said. \"But no-one with a school education seems to be interested in learning these handicraft skills any more.\"\n",

      "William Kam is a self-proclaimed, 100%-accurate face and palm reader. Located at the end of the Hong Kong's famous Temple Street night market, Kam's brightly-lit stall proudly displays his accreditation and 25 years of experience.\n",
      "Soothsayers first set up shop on Temple Street the 1970s, offering everything from palm and tarot card readings to \"bird fortune telling,\" where a small wing-clipped bird would peck out your future from a deck of cards.\n",
      "Kam expresses optimism about the future of his trade -- perhaps he knows something we don't.\n",
      "\"Twenty-two years ago, most of my customers were locals or people from (mainland) China, but now that this street is famous, I get people from all over the world. Tourists love it here. Hopefully that helps conserve this place.\"\n",

      "Cheung Shun King learned his trade from his father and grandfather in the family shop, where his first job was painting the tiles. Credit: Gary Jones\n",
      "Mahjong, a four-player game of skill and strategy, has been popular in Hong Kong for hundreds of years. It involves drawing and discarding tiles, each with a different character on it, to form winning hands.\n",
      "Today, most people opt for factory-made tiles, but Cheung Shun King continues to carve and sell them from his family shop. He mostly replaces lost or damaged tiles, though he occasionally engraves and paints entire sets from scratch. These sets cost about 4,000 Hong Kong dollars ($510) and take months to complete.\n",
      "Ironically, between work and his personal life, Cheung has never learned the game. \"I would rather rest than learn how to play mahjong,\" he said. \"But my children love to play.\"\n",
      "\"We can't do anything to help the industry, as mechanic production is replacing us,\" he added. \"I foresee that all mahjong shops in Hong Kong will disappear (within) ten years.\"\n",

      "When qipaos were widely worn in Hong Kong, tailor Kan Hon Wing's family store, Mei Wah Fashion, would sell hundreds of the garments a week. Credit: Gary Jones\n",
      "Established in the 1920s, Mei Wah Fashion is the oldest and last remaining tailor of its kind, specializing in traditional qipaos and cheongsams. Master tailor Kan Hon Wing grew up in the store, which was originally opened by his grandfather.\n",
      "The qipao, or \"Mandarin gown,\" was once everyday attire in Hong Kong. They were worn by almost all women, regardless of social class, so tailors were in high demand. But nowadays, the garment is reserved for more formal occasions, such as banquets or weddings.\n",
      "Every piece must meet Kan's exacting standards, so it takes him more than a week to make one qipao. But with shrinking trade comes exclusivity: While a qipao in the 1920s could cost as little as one Hong Kong Dollar (13 cents), Kan's dresses today sell for up to 20,000 Hong Kong dollars ($2,549).\n",
      "\"Every qipao is unique,\" he said. \"Tailors need to be very detail-minded. I will give people suggestions if their 'dream qipao' is too ugly.\"\n",

      "Originally from Vietnam, Chen Kau has been a letter writer in Hong Kong for nearly 40 years. Credit: Gary Jones\n",
      "Letter writing was a profitable business in Hong Kong during the 1950s and 1960s, when the city's literacy rate was as low as 60%. Professional letter writers would help people contact relatives overseas, write legal documents and fill out forms or applications.\n",
      "But with the introduction of compulsory education, and the rapid evolution of technology, demand has fallen. There may now be fewer than 10 professional letter writers in the city.\n",
      "One of them, Chen Kau, has a handful of regular customers who he helps with tax forms, welfare applications or visas. Most days, he has none at all, so sits reading the newspaper or chatting.\n",
      "\"The development of technology like smartphones and computers is the biggest enemy of our industry,\" he said. \"But at the same time, it is essential for a city or any society to improve with time. There must be some jobs that are replaced or even eliminated.\"\n",

      "Stencil makers like Wu Ding Keung begin by drawing the Chinese characters onto thin iron sheets, before carefully cutting them out with a hammer and chisel. Credit: Gary Jones\n",
      "Stencil making is among Hong Kong's oldest trades and was once a thriving industry. The delicate process requires a sharp eye, a steady hand and expert calligraphy skills.\n",
      "Craftsmen first draw the Chinese characters onto thin iron sheets, then very carefully cut them out with a hammer and chisel. These hand-cut stencils were used for advertising, wall notices and shop signs, though they've have been largely replaced by digital or laser-cut alternatives.\n",
      "Wu Ding Keung is among Hong Kong's last stencil makers. Stooped over a small table with only a hammer and bag of chisels, the 82-year-old can go for days without seeing a single customer, but he continues working to keep himself busy.\n",
      "\"I've forgotten how long I've been working here, but I know I started before the handover of Hong Kong,\" Wu said.\n",
      "\"I once helped a couple make a stencil for their wedding party. I liked that.\"\n",

      "In the 1990s, there were about 1,000 shops developing film around Hong Kong. Now, there are fewer than 50. Most shop owners responded to the demise of film by switching to digital cameras, lenses, photo processing or printing, but a few hardy shops still sell film and analog camera equipment to passionate enthusiasts.\n",
      "Lo Sai Keung's shop, Sunrise Professional Photofinishing, is packed with new and second-hand cameras dating as far back as the 1930s.\n",
      "Nowadays, he develops about 20 to 30 rolls of film a day; however, in the 1970s and 1980s, he would process about 200 a day. Most of Lo's customers are young, curious photography students looking to try their hand at analog photography.\n",
      "\"Hong Kong people love selfies,\" he said. \"You can still do them with film cameras although it's harder and you would probably need a mirror.\"\n",

      "In the light of its uncompromising record, Ressa's arrest has been widely seen by human rights and journalist activist groups as a warning shot to the press.\n",
      "\"Rappler is a giant here, their body of work is really something,\" says Carlos Conde, a Human Rights Watch researcher based in Manila.\n",

      "Ressa's arrest \"sends an absolutely unequivocal message to anyone working in the Philippines,\" says Peter Greste, a former Al Jazeera journalist who was jailed in Egypt after producing work critical of the government. He is now an academic in his native Australia and founding director of the Alliance for Journalists' Freedom.\n",
      "\"You can't look at this in isolation, think of it in terms of what it means to the entire media in the Philippines -- if you question the administration, you can expect harassment, intimidation, and arrest.\"\n",
      "Why Maria Ressa's arrest should unnerve everyone\n",
      "Conde agrees, and says the message is stark. \"The message is: 'Don't mess with us. We're determined to make our vision for this country a reality.'\"\n",
      "Complicating matters is the culture of violence that Filipino journalists, even before Duterte's rise, have had to face. \"The Philippines is still one of the countries with the highest rates of journalist murders,\" Conde says. \"You can publish what you want, you just have to contend with the consequences. You die, you get intimidated or you become Maria Ressa.\"\n",
      "Press freedom around Asia\n",
      "The incident has reverberated through a region that is widely seen as becoming more and more illiberal, from China and North Korea, two of the world's least free countries for the media, to Thailand and Malaysia, which have cracked down harder on the press in recent years.\n",
      "\"It seems to be happening almost everywhere at the same time; it creates new norms and it is very worrying,\" says Florence de Changy, president of Hong Kong's Foreign Correspondents' Club and an Asia correspondent for French newspaper Le Monde.\n",

The index also lists Taiwan in the top 50. The rest of the Asia-Pacific region falls below that, due to varying levels of harassment, physical abuse, censorship and surveillance of journalists.\n",

      "Cédric Alviani, RSF's East Asia Bureau Chief, blames China for setting a bad example. The Asian giant ranks 176th of 180 in the index. \"In the past six years, the situation (in China) has worsened a lot. This comes from the bad example that the Chinese authorities are spreading in Asia.\"\n",
      "\"Other countries in Asia are copying this example. Thailand, the Philippines, it's very worrying,\" he says, citing the jailing of two Reuters journalists in Myanmar, and a government crackdown on bloggers in Vietnam. The Philippines currently ranks in 133rd place—a fall from 127th place in 2017.\n",
      "\"In Asia more and more you have the idea that media that are critical of the government are anti-patriotic, that they're against the people. This goes against everything we know about democracies, I would say that this is a situation that is very worrying.\"\n",

      "\"One of the challenges is that the figures cited are based on the private sector. It's private individuals paying private providers. Any type of figure tends to be relatively speculative.

The global medical tourism market is estimated to be around $45.5 billion to $72 billion.\n",

Using American health care costs as a benchmark, Patients Without Borders estimates savings ranging from 40% to 90%, depending on the country. In Taiwan, Thailand, Mexico and Turkey patients can save 40% to 65% on procedures and treatments.

But some Taiwan residents have another method for finding romance besides Tinder -- they call on the god of marriage and love.\n",
      "According to Chinese mythology, the Love God, or Yue Lao, is in possession of a \"book of marriages,\" and can find and bind you to the one you're meant to be with, with a red string.\n",

      "Taking this somewhat gruesome story to heart, many started believing in the Love God -- also referred to as \"The Matchmaker\" or \"The Old Man under the Moon\" -- starting in the Qing Dynasty (1644 to 1912), says associate professor Isaac Yue of the University of Hong Kong.\n",
      "Today, believers continue to pray at statues of his likeness throughout Asia. And while there are larger, more colorful, even blingier, Love God sculptures in the region, the one in Taipei's Xia Hai City God Temple is the most popular.\n",

It entails buying an offering set for around $9, then lighting incense, praying to the City God, his wife and the Love God, plus eating wedding cookies left by successful couples.\n",
      "When praying to the Love God, Lee says you have to be as detailed as possible. First introduce yourself by giving your name, age and address, and then give as much information as possible, right down to personality traits, of the person you want as your partner.\n",

      "After Bukele became mayor, the political relationship between him and his party began to deteriorate. Some analysts say the FMLN considered Bukele too harsh a critic of the then-government of Salvador Sánchez Cerén.\n",
      "In September 2017, municipal comptroller Xóchitl Marchelli accused Bukele of \"throwing an apple\" and calling her a \"witch\" during a meeting of the San Salvador City Council, which Bukele denied. The next month, the FMLN expelled Bukele, citing Marchelli's allegations and accusing Bukele of promoting divisions within the party.\n",

      "Bukele took to Facebook Live to announce that he would start a new political party called \"New Ideas,\" but it turned out to be a short-lived venture. Struggling to accredit the nascent party with the Supreme Electoral Tribunal while presidential elections loomed, Bukele abandoned New Ideas and joined an existing party called Democratic Change.\n",
      "Then in July 2018, Democratic Change was shut down along with three other parties for failing to acquire a minimum number of votes in the 2015 election. Bukele was forced to find a yet another political party to back his candidacy.\n",
      "Just six months before the elections, Bukele finally found GANA, a party that could last all the way to the presidency. And indeed it did.\n",

China and Taiwan clash in Lunar New Year military propaganda videos Tensions between Beijing and Taipei have been steadily increasing since 2016. The Chinese government has been placing greater military and economic pressure on Taiwan, which Beijing regards as part of its sovereign territory despite over 70 years of separation.\n",
      "In January, Chinese President Xi Jinping warned Taiwan that independence was \"a dead end\" and called for \"peaceful reunification.\"\n",

      "Singapore Art Week is now in full swing, but one event is conspicuous by its absence. The annual fair Art Stage Singapore -- once the centerpiece of the week-long program -- was canceled with just nine days' notice, leaving galleries out of pocket and scrabbling for venues to show their work.\n",
      "In an email sent to exhibitors, many of whom had already shipped works to the city, the fair's founder and director Lorenzo Rudolf asked galleries to \"cease all preparations ... or to reverse them.\" This proved impossible for some.\n",
      "Organizers are yet to offer guarantees of remuneration or an official explanation, and have yet to respond to CNN's multiple requests for comment. But the numbers tell a story by themselves -- not just of Art Stage Singapore's fate, but of the country's seemingly saturated art market.\n",
      "A visitor takes a photograph of an art installation at the Art Stage fair in Singapore in 2016. Credit: ROSLAN RAHMAN/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n",
      "Launched in 2011 as a hub connecting international buyers with contemporary Asian art, the 2016 fair sold 143 booths, attracting galleries from Asia and beyond. But this number has fallen in each year since, with just 97 exhibitors reported to have signed up in 2018 and fewer than 50 billed to appear this year, before the fair's cancellation. Visitor numbers fell too: from more than 50,000 in 2015 to 26,500 at the last edition.\n",
      "This decline has been echoed elsewhere in the country's packed arts calendar. The Singapore Contemporary Art Show, launched in 2016, ceased operations after just two editions, while the Affordable Art Fair, which focused on local collectors, went annual (rather than biannual) amid reports of declining sales.\n",
      "Yet, new events have emerged in their place. The new S.E.A. Focus fair, held for the first time this week, is more geared toward southeast Asian art than Art Stage Singapore was, although its timing put them in direct competition. And a new large-scale venture, Art SG, is set launch this November, promising 60 to 70 \"established and experimental galleries from Singapore, Southeast Asia and the world.\"\n",

      "London-based dealer Tanya Baxter, whose eponymous gallery was due to appear at Art Stage Singapore, points to growing competition and the abundance of events as a problem for the city's art market. She also suggested that stilted galleries might stand to lose anything from £10,000 to £40,000 ($13,000 to $52,000) if the fair doesn't provide compensation.\n",
      "An art installation titled \"Water Dripping - Splashing\" is displayed at Art Stage Singapore in 2016. Credit: ROSLAN RAHMAN/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n",
      "\"It was packed and confusing,\" she said of the country's arts program in a phone interview, \"and people get conflicted.\"\n",
      "\"I think (Singapore is) ambitious, but it tries too much,\" she added.\n",
      "But Baxter sees Art Stage's demise as indicative of organizers' mismanagement, rather than a stagnating art market (she reports robust sales at the fair in recent years). It's a view shared by Jasdeep Sandhu, founder of Singapore's Gajah Gallery, who has previously exhibited at Art Stage.\n",
      "\"Fifteen, twenty years ago, the Singapore art market was in the doldrums -- prices couldn't sustain a decent art economy here,\" he said in a phone interview. \"In 2006, 2007 and 2008 an art boom started and just moved everything up. It's come down from the highs (of a few years ago). But if you look at a 15-year perspective, it's still very much on the up.\"\n",
      "Regional competition\n",
      "From the late 1980s Singapore has tried to position itself as an international force in the arts world. Since 1991, the National Arts Council (NAC) has offered significant funding at all levels of the arts and culture sectors.\n",
      "The government's ambitions were more formally articulated in the 2000 initiative dubbed the Renaissance City Plan, which aimed to use generous public funding to \"establish Singapore as a global arts city.\" Citing places like New York and London as benchmarks, the initiative has aimed to build arts infrastructure, develop grassroots arts and internationalize Singapore's offering.\n",
      "In the last financial year, the NAC handed out more than 68 million Singapore dollars ($51 million) in grants, scholarships and bursaries. As well as providing support to artists, public money is responsible for a huge number of arts events and initiatives around the city. Recent years have seen the launch of a Singapore Biennale, in 2006, a School of the Arts, in 2008 and a National Gallery, in 2015.\n",
      "\"Flower Tree\" by artist Choi Jeong-Hwa unveiled at VivoCity in conjunction with Singapore Biennale in 2006. Credit: AFP/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n",
      "The plan appears to have borne fruit: Between 1996 and 2015, yearly attendance at ticketed arts events increased from 750,000 to more than 1.9 million, while the \"value added\" by the arts and culture sector to Singapore's economy tripled to $1.7 billion, according to official figures.\n",
      "Yet, Singapore's ambitions to become a regional hub for international collectors faces significant challenges from elsewhere in Asia. The now-reticent Art Stage founder, Lorenzo Rudolf, has previously decried \"stagnation\" in the country's art scene, citing \"booms\" in other countries like Philippines and Thailand.\n",

      "Emerging markets like Indonesia and mainland China have launched major commercial art events in recent years. And, last week, Taiwan opened its inaugural Taipei Dangdai fair, grabbing the region's attention just days ahead of the ill-fated Singapore fair, which was due to open today. (Sandhu said that his participation at Taipei Dangdai was a major reason why he didn't sign up for Art Stage.)\n",
      "Perhaps most prominently, Art Basel Hong Kong -- which Rudolf himself helped build into an art world powerhouse -- still dominates Asia's fair market, attracting more than 240 exhibitors and 80,000 attendees last year.\n",
      "90-sec dance through Hong Kong's glamorous art week\n",
      "\"The Singapore market obviously pales in insignificance to Hong Kong, but it gets a lot of collectors from the region and they are strong collectors,\" said Baxter. \"Hong Kong became an international player and there's no reason why Singapore can't. If you look at the whole area, it's a huge region with a lot of wealth.\n",
      "\"Singapore doesn't have to be in first place,\" she added. \"It can be a really nice mirror to Hong Kong.\"\n",
      "Sandhu, who founded his gallery more than 20 years ago, also plays down the comparison between the two cities.\n",
      "\"Hong Kong is a completely different model, and if you look at Hong Kong you might trip yourself up,\" he said. \"We have a very distinct art culture in this part of the world.\"\n",
      "Developing an arts scene\n",
      "While known as a hub for collectors in Asia, Singapore is not renowned for its homegrown art. For Sandhu, state funding -- which still accounts for a huge portion of arts spending in Singapore -- is helping to improve the city-state's grassroots art scene.\n",
      "\"Singapore has never been known as a city that produces artists but (the government) started building infrastructure and improving art schools almost 30 years ago,\" he said. \"You now have a very sustainable art community where young artists can actually survive.\"\n",
      "But for Singaporean photographer Nguan, whose work has been exhibited at galleries in the city, public money acts as a barrier to a thriving art scene.\n",
      "\"I wasn't surprised by Art Stage's demise,\" he said over email. \"(But) I don't think the absence of a booming art market is necessarily a bad thing -- the commercial art market in Japan, for example, is also relatively small, but their museums are packed.\n",
      "An image by Singaporean photographer Nguan, who said: \"Art has to happen in the cracks; organically, or not at all.\" Credit: Nguan\n",
      "\"Our authorities have spent a lot of money trying to manufacture an art scene in the most inorganic of ways,\" he added. \"I think they're finding that a culture of art-making and appreciation cannot be developed as if it were a piece of land.\n",
      "\"Art has to happen in the cracks; organically, or not at all,\" said Nguan, who called for reduced regulation on exhibitions and tax incentives to encourage private investment in the arts.\n",
      "From brothels to spiral staircases, photographer captures unseen Singapore\n",
      "Whatever Singapore's commercial fortunes, its art community can take heart from the solidarity displayed during the past week. A Facebook page, \"Art Stage SOS,\" has been established to help stranded participants find new ways to exhibit their work. And the not-for-profit group Art Outreach has arranged a pop-up fair at the original venue -- Singapore's famous Marina Bay Sands -- which will run across Art Stage's original dates.\n",
      "\"It is heartening though to see many galleries and groups coming forward to support the affected exhibitors,\" said Singapore's minister for culture, Grace Fu, at the opening of the S.E.A Focus fair Wednesday evening, according to a NAC transcript. \"The camaraderie and strong spirit of the arts sector was in full demonstration.\n",
      "\"That we can respond so well and so quickly to the situation that Art Stage created, shows the network and depth of the Singapore visual arts ecosystem.\"\n",

      "At the Monday press conference, the flight attendant was accompanied by a representative of the local flight attendants' union and fellow EVA employee. The union representative told reporters the man had flown EVA from the US to Asia numerous times. He had defecated in his seat during a flight last May after the crew rejected his demands, causing a foul smell in the entire cabin for over 10 hours, the representative said.\n",
      "Another union representative said the passenger's behavior should be considered sexual harassment.\n",
      "EVA, which is known for hiring only female flight attendants, defended its treatment of the passenger in a press statement Monday, saying he had flown with the airline more than 20 times and mostly without incident.\n",
      "Expressing its \"sincere gratitude\" to the cabin crew for their actions during his latest trip, the airline pledged to further investigate the passenger and explore options -- ranging from placing him on a \"no-fly\" list to requiring someone to accompany him on flights.

      "China says hypersonic aircraft test a success 00:30\n",
      "In a written introduction accompanying the report, the Defense Intelligence Agency's director, Lt. Gen. Robert Ashley, wrote that China has used a variety of means to acquire advanced technology to bolster its military capabilities despite some countries attempting to limit its access to that technology over international concerns about Beijing's human rights policies.\n",
      "\"China shifted funds and efforts to acquiring technology by any means available. Domestic laws forced foreign partners of Chinese-based joint ventures to release their technology in exchange for entry into China's lucrative market, and China has used other means to secure needed technology and expertise,\" Ashley said.\n",
      "While the report acknowledges that China spends significantly less on defense than the some $700 billion invested by the US in 2018, it says Beijing enjoys an advantage due to the fact that \"China has not had to invest in costly R&D of new technologies to the same degree as the United States.\"\n",
      "\"Rather, China has routinely adopted the best and most effective platforms found in foreign militaries through direct purchase, retrofits, or theft of intellectual property. By doing so, China has been able to focus on expediting its military modernization at a small fraction of the original cost,\" it said.\n",
      "'Most modern weapon systems in the world'\n",
      "China is \"on the verge of fielding some of the most modern weapon systems in the world. In some areas, it already leads the world,\" Ashley wrote.\n",
      "A senior defense official said the US was concerned that China's increased capabilities may lead its military commanders to advise its political leaders that they were confident of military success with regard to a campaign against Taiwan.\n",
      "\"The biggest concern is that they are going to get to -- they are getting to a point where the PLA leadership may actually tell Xi Jinping that they are confident in their capabilities,\" the official said, referring to China's leader.\n",
      "China's reaction to US Navy operation: We have missiles\n",
      "The report notes that the vast majority of China's missile arsenal is capable of hitting Taiwan while also pointing out that Beijing has developed new weapons systems like the H-6 bomber armed with CJ-20 cruise missiles, which it says is capable of striking areas farther afield, such as US military installations on Guam.\n",
      "It says, \"China has built or acquired a wide array of advanced platforms,\" including submarines, major surface combat ships, missile patrol craft, maritime strike aircraft and land-based systems that employ new, sophisticated anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missiles.\n",
      "\"China also has developed the world's first roadmobile, anti-ship ballistic missile, a system specifically designed to attack enemy aircraft carriers,\" it says.\n",
      "\"China's leaders hope that possessing these military capabilities will deter pro-independence moves by Taiwan or, should deterrence fail, will permit a range of tailored military options against Taiwan and potential third-party military intervention,\" the report said.\n",
      "Earlier this month Xi called on Taiwan to reject independence and embrace \"peaceful reunification\" with China in a conciliatory speech that nevertheless took a hard line on the self-governing island's political sovereignty and freedoms.\n",
      "Xi Jinping warns Taiwan independence is 'a dead end'\n",
      "And the Chinese leader added that \"we make no promise to renounce the use of force. We reserve the option for all the necessary means.\"\n",
      "In response to Xi's speech, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen said the island will \"never accept\" a \"one country, two systems\" arrangement with China.\n",
      "While the report says China has increased its military footprint in the South China Sea and has placed additional military facilities on man-made islands there, the Pentagon assesses that China is seeking to avoid a conflict.\n",
      "\"I think both sides have managed to operate professionally. And we have -- it's not in the Chinese interests for a crisis to spiral in the South China Sea. I think that they are fairly comfortable with the progress they've made in building out this infrastructure down there, and then working on negotiations with the other claimant states over a longer term,\" the senior defense official said.\n",

      "During his China visit, Adm. Richardson said the US Navy would continue to send warships wherever international law allows, something the Pentagon says when undertaking so-called \"freedom of navigation\" operations near Chinese-claimed territory in the South China Sea.\n",
      "\"The US Navy will continue to conduct routine and lawful operations around the world, in order to protect the rights, freedoms and lawful uses of sea and airspace guaranteed to all,\" Richardson said in a China-datelined story posted on the US Navy's website.\n",
      "He also called on China to avoid dangerous maneuvers during those US operations.\n",
      "\"It important for all military, law enforcement, and civilian vessels and aircraft, including those in the PLA Navy, the Chinese Coast Guard, and the People's Armed Forces Maritime Militia, to operate in a safe and professional manner, in accordance with international law,\" Richardson is quoted as saying. \"Consistent operations and behavior are critical to preventing miscalculation.\"\n",
      "Last fall, the Chinese destroyer Lanzhou came within 45 yards (41 meters) of the guided-missile destroyer USS Decatur near the Spratly Islands in an encounter the US called \"unsafe.\" Taiwan appoints new Premier amid rising China tensions Last week, Chinese President Xi Jinping called on Taiwan to reject moves towards formal independence and embrace \"peaceful reunification\" with his country, suggesting the island adopt the concept of \"one country, two systems\" as used in Hong Kong when China regained sovereignty over the city from the UK in 1997.\n",
      "While his speech sounded more conciliatory than previously, Xi did not rule out using military force to take Taiwan. In the past he has vowed not to cede \"a single inch of our motherland,\" and increased military drills around the self-ruled and democratic island of 23 million people.\n",
      "Tsai rejected Xi's \"one country, two systems\" suggestion outright, and on Friday she emphasized that Taiwan's priorities in 2019 include protecting its democracy and safeguarding its sovereignty, in addition to improving people's livelihoods.\n",
      "She acknowledged the challenges ahead as Taiwan, whose economy is closely linked to that of China, tackles the fallout of the trade war between Washington and Beijing, as well as renewed fears of Xi's hardline stance.\n",
      "China and Taiwan -- officially the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China, respectively -- split in 1949 following the Communist victory on the mainland after a bloody civil war.\n",
      "They have been governed separately ever since although a shared cultural and linguistic heritage largely endures, with Mandarin the official language in both places. Surgeries in Mexico linked to antibiotic-resistant infections in US, CDC says The CDC says the Mexican government has closed Grand View Hospital \"until further notice,\" but the agency still suggests that travelers not have surgery there until the authorities have confirmed that the drug-resistant bacteria are no longer present.\n",
      "Medical tourism\n",
      "\"Medical tourism,\" or traveling to another country for medical care, is a growing trend around the world. Between 11 million and 14 million people travel each year for medical care, according to industry estimates. Top destinations include Costa Rica, India, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and the United States, according to Patients Beyond Borders, a guide to medical tourism. Many people are drawn by the potential for lower costs.\n",
      "British surgeons warned not to perform Brazilian butt lift surgery\n",
      "The Medical Tourism Association, an international trade organization that acts as a liaison between patients and international providers, estimated the industry's worth at $100 billion in 2016-17.\n",
      "According to its latest survey of providers, about 72% of the patients who used medical tourism traveled for cancer, spine and other orthopedic treatments, followed by cosmetic and plastic surgery procedures, and cardiovascular and neurosurgeries.\n",
      "Over 50% of the surgeries cost between $10,000 and $50,000, while 16% were between $50,000 and $100,000, the survey said.\n",
      "Caution advised\n",
      "There are significant risks in traveling abroad for medical treatment, the CDC cautions.\n",
      "Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter\n",
      "Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n",
      "\"Antibiotic resistance is a global problem, and resistant bacteria may be more common in other countries than in the United States,\" the agency warns.\n",
      "The CDC has a number of suggestions for anyone thinking about medical tourism, including researching the health care provider or surgeon, as well as the clinic or hospital. Choose internationally credentialed facilities, and be aware that standards for providers and clinics in other countries may be different than those in the United States. Law firm that represented Russian interests part of mystery Mueller subpoena case He is also experienced in international work, listing among his past clients Korean and Australian companies. And Boone lists among his past clients the Republican National Committee regarding public records litigation.\n",
      "Kang, Boone and firm leadership have not responded to multiple inquiries from CNN over the past several months. The firm's involvement in the case gives a few clues to whom its client may be.\n",
      "Key Senate Republican: Attorney general nominee committed to allowing Mueller to finish\n",
      "Typically, large law firms like Alston & Bird represent masses of clients among their hundreds of partners. Only when a client allows it may a firm publicly acknowledge whom they represent. The Washington Post reported Tuesday night that the company is a foreign financial institution, citing two sources familiar with the case.\n",
      "Lawyers in closed-door hearings\n",
      "CNN first spotted the mystery court activity in September last year, when lawyers appeared in the courtroom for DC District Court Chief Judge Beryl Howell opposite five prosecutors from Mueller's team. At that time, one of the corporate lawyers told CNN he was from Alston & Bird and represented \"a country.\"\n",
      "Another mystery court hearing before Howell happened in October, with Kang and Boone opposite Mueller's team, including top criminal appellate advocate Michael Dreeben.\n",
      "After the hearing, a CNN reporter approached Kang and Boone about their client but they declined to comment.\n",
      "Analysis: Unredacted Paul Manafort filing hints at collusion\n",
      "After Howell denied the company's challenge twice, the case then moved to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Politico reported at that time that the appeals case related to Mueller's investigation.\n",
      "When the scheduled arguments happened in December before the three-judge appellate panel, court officials were so careful not to reveal the identities of the lawyers involved that they cleared the public and media from an entire floor of the DC federal courthouse.\n",
      "The company lost its challenge of the subpoena soon after. At that point, the DC Circuit judges were able to say that the subpoena sought information from a foreign state-owned company. They revealed little else about the case.\n",
      "The company then took its fight to the US Supreme Court. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court denied it would continue to freeze daily fines placed upon the company for noncompliance. The court also said the company could file its broader challenge of the subpoena and its legal reasoning with some details still confidential. If and when that filing comes in, it could identify the appellate lawyers involved on both sides.\n",

      "Alston & Bird\n",
      "Alston & Bird's history of working for Russians dates back to the early 2000s.\n",
      "The Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, a business contact of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort whom Mueller's team has sought information about, paid Alston & Bird $300,000 upfront in 2003 to help him reinstate his US visa, according to public lobbying disclosure filings. Over the next few years, Deripaska paid the firm another $270,000 for their work, the filings say. Around that time, Deripaska gave Manafort a $10 million loan, which the FBI cited in a 2017 search warrant on Manafort.\n",
      "The law firm is one of the largest in the world by revenue and one of the US' 50 largest law firms, according to legal industry data. The firm operates only two international offices, in Beijing and Brussels.\n",
      "In a tense situation like the Mueller investigation, it's likely the firm's representation of the company and foreign state fall in line with past clients, so as not to pose ethical or business conflicts.\n",
      "Alston & Bird's most well-known employee is former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, who has contributed to the firm's foreign and domestic lobbying business for years. The lobbying side of the firm works directly for two foreign governments, Kosovo and Taiwan, according to foreign lobbying disclosures.\n",
      "Mueller believes Manafort fed information to Russian with intel ties\n",
      "The firm has also had a lobbying team focus on reform of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act -- the same law at issue in the mystery company's grand jury challenge.\n",
      "It has also done work for global public relations firm Ketchum Inc., which hired it to \"provide advisory services to Ketchum, Inc. for the Russian Federation.\" This included gathering information on contemporary US-Russia relations and monitoring \"legislative developments in the Congress in similar issue areas,\" according to filings from 2014.\n",
      "For years, Ketchum helped the Kremlin and state entities like Gazprom with public relations campaigns intended to influence US public opinion and policy. Astronaut: What China's moon landing means for US Astronaut: Trump's plan for the space station a huge mistake\n",
      "While China is preparing its space station, with plans to start sending parts up in 2020, America is planning to exit the International Space Station -- the collaborative effort of 15 nations -- in 2024-2025. According to an internal NASA document obtained by The Washington Post in early 2018, the plan is based on the unrealistic idea that we can transition management of the facility to a commercial entity.\n",
      "The ISS was never designed to be operated profitably. Mission control centers in Houston and Moscow must be permanently staffed to support it, and launch and landing costs would be prohibitive to any commercial entity.\n",
      "Meanwhile, China could land astronauts on the moon as early as the 2030s, leapfrogging NASA in their lunar capabilities.\n",
      "But perhaps the US should have seen this coming. In 1965, at the height of the Apollo program, NASA had 5.3% of the federal budget. Today, even though the budget is a slightly higher than it has been in recent years, it sits at around just 0.4%.\n",

      "With those measly funds, NASA's ambitions are inevitably limited. This doesn't seem likely to change, with the White House seemingly more intent on creating the so-called \"Space Force,\" a new military branch, than investing in a real space exploration program.\n",
      "To be fair, we are still doing some amazing things in space. Very recently, the New Horizons spacecraft, after making groundbreaking discoveries and images of Pluto, went on to image Ultima Thule -- by far the most distant object ever imaged -- at about 4 billion miles from Earth. The OSIRIS REx spacecraft established orbit around the 500 meter-diameter asteroid Bennu, some 100 million km from Earth. It will bring back a sample of the asteroid for analysis. The Parker Solar Probe is performing ground-breaking measurements of our sun. The Mars InSight spacecraft just landed on Mars to do studies that have never been done before, like seismic studies.\n",

      "These great missions notwithstanding, our space program could be on the verge of being outdone. It is a classic case of the \"Tortoise and the Hare.\" We have been so used to being on top for so long that our politicians have gotten complacent.\n",
      "Indeed, the failure to prioritize our space capabilities is nothing new. President Barack Obama proclaimed that America would go to Mars by the 2030s but did not sufficiently prioritize funding the program.\n",
      "Now we have come to the moment of China's ascendency in space exploration. We must face the reality that it has, in a small but significant way, shown the world that it can be the first to accomplish things in space, too. We had better realize this soon, or we may very well wake up to find that we are no longer top dog in the space business. And if we don't learn from our complacency in space, we could end up losing our edge in other areas as well.\n",
      "Correction: This piece originally misstated how far Bennu is from Earth. It has been updated to reflect the correct distance.

      "Scientology was accorded the status of an official religion, which gives it tax exemption, in Australia in 1983. Xi Jinping warns Taiwan independence is 'a dead end' Cross-strait tensions\n",
      "Xi's speech comes a day after Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen gave her own New Year's address, in which she called on Beijing to \"face the reality of the existence of the Republic of China,\" referring to the island by its official name. She also urged that Beijing to \"respect the commitment of the 23 million people of Taiwan to freedom and democracy.\"\n",
      "Tsai resigned as head of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in November after the historically pro-independence party suffered a crushing defeat in local government elections, which also saw voters reject a proposal for the island to compete in international sporting events as \"Taiwan\" rather than \"Chinese Taipei,\" a moniker adopted after pressure from Beijing.\n",
      "While she acknowledged the elections were a \"serious test for the current government,\" Tsai said the results \"absolutely do not mean that grassroots public opinion in Taiwan favors abandoning our sovereignty, nor do they mean that the people want to make concessions regarding Taiwanese identity.\"\n",
      "She also pointed to allegations of Chinese influence over those elections, saying Beijing's \"attempts to use the openness and freedom of our democratic system to interfere in Taiwan's internal politics and social development (have) now become Taiwan's greatest challenge.\"\n",
      "During his speech, Xi said China had \"achieved a great victory in frustrating the Taiwan independence movement and other separatist activities.\"\n",
      "Lev Nachman, a Taiwan specialist and PhD student in Political Science at the University of California Irvine, said this appeared to be an oblique acknowledgment of interference in the island's politics.\n",
      "\"I am not sure we are going to get a more clear direct admittance from Xi himself that the (Chinese Communist Party) interferes with Taiwan's democratic elections,\" he said. \"This is something we have always known was a phenomenon, but never really had any 'hard proof'.\"\n",
      "Nachman said Xi's speech showed Beijing \"now more than ever anticipates that Taiwan will naturally head towards a unification path.\"\n",
      "\"If the CCP is confident it can stop the DPP from maintaining its status as the governing party and can even actively help restore the KMT to power, it has no need to use force,\" he added, referring to the pro-unification Kuomintang, which governed Taiwan for decades following the Chinese civil war.\n",

      "Hong Kong model\n",
      "Throughout his speech -- and those of other Chinese officials introducing him -- Xi pointed to \"One Country, Two Systems\" as the model for Taiwanese reunification.\n",
      "That is the principle by which Hong Kong transferred from British to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, maintaining the city's limited democracy, economic system and political freedoms under Chinese rule. For many years, Hong Kong was seen as a model for Taiwan, an advertisement for future reunification, and Xi's speech harkened back to this.\n",
      "\"One Country, Two Systems was raised to accommodate Taiwan's reality and safeguard the interests and benefits of Taiwan compatriots ... under the precondition of ensuring national sovereignty and national security,\" Xi said.\n",
      "How attractive a model Hong Kong is to many in Taiwan is debatable, however, as recent years have seen Beijing renege on promises to expand democratic rights, and multiple prominent pro-democracy figures have been jailed, harassed and banned from standing for election. Political and press freedoms have also declined in the city.\n",
      "\"Xi's call to Hong Kong as the One Country, Two Systems experiment I think shows what an ideal 'unification' looks like from Beijing's perspective: put Taiwan in a position that allows some autonomy still, but slowly erode it until it is retaken completely,\" Nachman said.\n",
      "\"Xi would like Taiwanese people to see themselves as in the same position as Hong Kongers, which they do not.\"\n",
      "Speaking in Taipei Wednesday following Xi's speech, Tsai said the island would not accept a Hong Kong-style arrangement, and called on Beijing to respect Taiwan's political sovereignty.\n",

      "\"We are willing to create broad space for peaceful reunification, but will leave no room for any form of separatist activities,\" he said.\n",
      "\"We make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means,\" he said, adding that the \"issue of Taiwan is part of China's domestic politics (and) foreign interference is intolerable.\"\n",

      "An American arrested last week in Russia is no spy, his family says. Paul Whelan, a 48-year-old corporate security director from Michigan, was detained by the Russians and accused of spying. Whelan, who has been to Russia many times, was there for a wedding, his twin brother told CNN. If convicted of spying, Whelan could get 20 years in prison. His arrest comes just weeks after Russian Maria Butina pleaded guilty to trying to infiltrate GOP political circles and influence US relations with Russia before the 2016 election.

      "A new year means New Year's greetings from world leaders. Last year, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un offered South Korea an olive branch in his New Year's address. That kicked off a year of summits and a promise by the North to get rid of its nukes. In this year's address, Kim said that's still the plan (though there's no evidence the North is actually doing it). But he warned the US the North may need to pursue \"a new way\" to peace on the Korean Peninsula if the Americans keep making \"one-sided demands\" and threatening more sanctions. Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping gave a New Year's address of his own and used it to caution Taiwan that independence is \"a dead end.\"\n",
