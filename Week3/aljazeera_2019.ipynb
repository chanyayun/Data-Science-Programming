Taiwan's president says her government will \"follow humanitarian principles\" when dealing with asylum seekers from Hong Kong.\n",

Trump: Squeezing the Chinese is having a 'major effect' As US-China talks drag on, Trump cites weak Chinese growth data and warns more squeezing could come. United States President Donald Trump has seized on slowing economic growth in China as evidence that US tariffs are having \"a major effect\", and he warned on Monday that Washington could pile on more pressure, as talks to end the trade war between the two countries continue sputtering along.\n",
      "Data released earlier on Monday showed that growth in China had slowed to 6.2 percent in the second quarter, its weakest pace in at least 27 years, amid ongoing pressure from the US-China trade war.\n",
      "\"This is why China wants to make a deal with the U.S., and wishes it had not broken the original deal in the first place,\" Trump tweeted.\n",
      "Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping last month agreed to another truce in the year-long trade dispute between the world's two largest economies. That agreement, announced after the leaders met in Osaka, Japan, was aimed at kickstarting stalled negotiations, but no deadline has been set for the process to conclude.\n",
      "The US president has grown increasingly frustrated that China has not delivered on what he views as a promise to start buying more US agricultural goods, even as talks continued.\n",
      "But sources familiar with the state of negotiations insisted to the Reuters news agency that the Chinese side did not make firm commitments at the meeting to purchase agricultural commodities immediately.\n",
      "Upcoming talks?\n",
      "Adding to mounting pressure on China, Trump will sign an order on Monday seeking to increase the US domestic content threshold for iron and steel in federal procurements, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on Fox News.\n",
      "The move, which aims to boost the threshold from 50 percent to 95 percent, comes amid continued concerns over overproduction by China, the world's biggest steel producer.\n",
      "Official data showed that China's daily crude steel output rose to record levels in June, according to calculations by Reuters, even as anti-pollution production curbs pushed whole-month production slightly lower.\n",
      "US and Chinese trade negotiators spoke by phone last week, and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will travel to Beijing \"in the very near future\", Navarro said last week. However, no date for the meeting has been announced.\n",
      "One source familiar with the negotiations said the US side wants China to clarify which negotiating document will form the basis for the talks before locking in a firm date for the in-person meeting.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Chinese embassy in Washington and Ambassador Cui Tiankai have both launched Twitter accounts, keen to amp up visibility in the US capital for Beijing's views on trade talks, Taiwan and other issues. Cui already has over 10,000 followers, less than a week after getting on the social media platform. China says will cut ties with US firms selling arms to Taiwan US companies vulnerable to sanctions include tank engine maker Honeywell and private jets maker Gulfstream. China's government and Chinese companies will cut business ties with US firms selling arms to Taiwan, the Chinese foreign ministry has said, in a move likely to worsen already poor ties with Washington.\n",
      "China claims self-ruled and democratic Taiwan as its own and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under Beijing's control. China regularly calls Taiwan the most sensitive issue in its relations with the United States.\n",
      "Last week, the Pentagon said the US State Department had approved the sale of the weapons requested by Taiwan, including 108 General Dynamics Corp M1A2T Abrams tanks and 250 Stinger missiles, which are manufactured by Raytheon.\n",
      "China said on Friday it would sanction US companies selling weapons to Taiwan but did not elaborate.\n",
      "The latest deal involves $2.2bn worth of tanks, missiles and related equipment for Taiwan.\n",

      "On Sunday, the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily posted an article on its WeChat account identifying US companies that could be vulnerable to sanctions.\n",
      "They included Honeywell International Inc, which makes the engines for the Abrams tanks, and private jets maker Gulfstream Aerospace, which is owned by General Dynamics. China is an important market for both Honeywell and Gulfstream.\n",

      "US defence contractors have been barred from dealings with Beijing since China's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in and around Tiananmen Square in 1989.\n",

Nike supplier pivots away from Vietnam after exiting China Eclat Textile looks to other countries to diversify its manufacturing hubs after Trump imposes tariffs on Vietnam. The new normal of global trade is that there are few safe harbors.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s the lesson Eclat Textile Co. is learning. The sportswear supplier to Nike Inc. and Lululemon Athletica Inc. exited China in 2016 as conditions weren’t ideal for manufacturing, deciding instead to bulk up in Vietnam. Now, as the global trade war heats up, Eclat finds itself vulnerable again and needs to move beyond Vietnam.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Judging from the global situation, the most important thing now is diversification,” Chairman Hung Cheng-hai said in an interview. “Clients also want us to diversify risks and don’t want production bases to be in one country. Now 50% of our garments are made in Vietnam, so we are not diversified enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Heightened trade tensions between the U.S. and China have disrupted global supply lines, forcing companies to pivot production out of the Asian nation and into other countries such as Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh. But with Donald Trump hardening his stance on Vietnam, calling it the biggest trade abuser and slapping higher import duties on steel, firms are realizing that no nation is tariff-proof enough to serve as a global supply hub.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eclat is now looking to set up multiple, smaller regional manufacturing hubs that can be nimble in servicing clients. The textile maker won’t consider adding plants or expanding in Vietnam in the next three years, Hung says.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company instead will invest in new facilities in Southeast Asian nations such as Indonesia or Cambodia. It expects to invest $80 million in setting up 120 production lines in the region, with the board deciding specific locations later this year, Hung says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eclat shares advanced 3.5% on Monday -- their biggest jump in more than two months -- outstripping the 0.5% rise in Taiwan’s benchmark Taiex index.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eclat is ahead of its peers in terms of diversification, giving it a “competitive advantage in the supply chain” and boding well for its long term future, said Helen Chien, a Daiwa analyst based in Taipei.\n",
      "Plan B\n",
      "Although the U.S. and China have resumed talks on a deal, there are growing signs that the global supply chain -- long reliant on China as the workshop to the world -- is being permanently transformed. Intel Corp. has said it’s reviewing its global supply chain, while Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are among those reportedly working on a Plan B.\n",
      "But the rush to nearby Asian nations is also reaching a saturation point. “Vietnam, for example, is full, completely full,” Spencer Fung, chief executive officer of Li & Fung Ltd., the world’s largest supplier of consumer goods, told Bloomberg earlier this month.\n",
      "Eclat escaped the hit of higher U.S. tariffs because it shut its Chinese facility in 2016 due to a shortage of local manpower. “The era of ‘Made in China’ was over five years back,” because the young Chinese workers -- products of the ‘One Child Policy’ -- no longer like working in a factory, according to Hung. “We will be cautious about investing in China and won’t invest in labor-intensive businesses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A dispersed supply chain will lower any potential tariff risks for Eclat and may even help lower costs in the long term, according to Rae Hsing, an analyst at Cathay Securities in Taipei who has a neutral rating on the textile firm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eclat’s strategy seems to be working, with the company reporting a 44% rise in profit for 2018 compared with a year earlier. Its stock has gained 13% this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hung sees flexibility as key. For example, tariff-related uncertainty has made it difficult for clients to plan their supply-chain requirements, causing them to be more conservative in placing orders. Eclat has adapted by moving faster to deliver orders. That willingness to be flexible will help the company take any further surprises in stride.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If this is worrisome, then we need to worry about investing in India or Mexico as well,” he said. “Then, there is no end of worrying.” China-friendly Taiwan mayor named opposition party's candidate Kuomintang party's Han Kuo-yu will challenge President Tsai Ing-wen in the election scheduled for January. A populist mayor who favours closer ties with China was announced as the presidential candidate for Taiwan's opposition on Monday, posing a challenge to President Tsai Ing-wen in upcoming elections.\n",
      "Han Kuo-yu won the primary for the opposition Kuomintang party (KMT), comfortably seeing off a challenge from Taiwan's richest man, billionaire Foxconn founder Terry Gou.\n",
      "\n",
      "His victory sets up an unpredictable clash as Taiwan goes to the polls in January in a contest that will be dominated by relations with China.\n",
      "The self-ruled island is set to hold elections amid heightened tension with China, which considers it a wayward province and has never ruled out the use of force to return it to the fold.\n",
      "Last week, China slammed the US for a potential arms sale worth $2.2bn to Taiwan.\n",
      "190714053228921\n",
      "President Tsai has said the island faced threats from \"overseas forces\", in a veiled reference to China, days after the weapons deal with Washington.\n",
      "Han, 62, gained island-wide popularity after winning the mayoral election in November in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, formerly a stronghold for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).\n",
      "\"The past three years under the rule of Tsai Ing-wen have been too disappointing,\" Han told reporters at KMT's headquarters in Taipei after the results. \"DPP supporters should open their eyes and think it over.\"\n",
      "'Han tide'\n",
      "Han won 45 percent of votes cast in the KMT's primary - which polls members of the public by telephone - compared with Gou's 28 percent, a setback for a man who made his fortune assembling iPhones and other key electronic devices in Chinese mainland factories.\n",

The 'deal of the century' as a deliberate deception Kushner's plan recycles failed past proposals and will clearly not succeed. But was it meant to in the first place? Proposing an economic approach to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is nothing new and it was definitely not pioneered by President Donald Trump and his adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner. It was put forward many times in the past by both the Israeli side, most prominently represented by Israeli leader Shimon Peres and his New Middle East vision, and by various international mediators, including the Quartet on the Middle East, which was created by the UN, US, EU and Russia after the Second Intifada.\n",
      "Needless to say, all past proposals have failed for one simple reason: They all suffered from an imbalance between economics and politics. Kushner's \"deal of the century\" has by far surpassed all others in this regard by completely decoupling politics from economic solutions.\n",
      "Since the 1990 Madrid conference, the peace process had been built on the principle of \"land for peace\", where Israel withdraws from Arab land it occupied in 1967 in exchange for peace and the normalisation of relations with the Palestinians and Arabs. This was also the core of the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative proposed by Saudi Arabia.\n",
      "Regardless of its shortcomings, the 1993 Oslo Accords provided a political vision for Peres's plan - a two-state solution - which was followed by the 1994 Paris Protocol which established rules regulating economic relations between the Palestinians and Israelis.\n",
      "Kushner decided to replace this principle with his idea of \"peace to prosperity\", which effectively reduces the conflict to an economic problem that can be resolved by improving the living standard of the Palestinians.\n",
      "The absence of a proposed solution for major political issues, particularly Palestinian statehood, the status of Jerusalem, and the right of return, render his proposal nothing more than an attempt to bribe the Palestinians into giving up self-determination.\n",
      "Another major issue with Kushner's plan is that the source of funding for its ambitious $50bn budget is still unclear. Europe, traditionally a major donor, did not attend the workshop. Russia and China were not part of it either.\n",
      "Saudi Arabia, which has shown the most enthusiasm for the deal, is already dealing with its own economic problems and the war in Yemen, which has cost it billions of dollars. The US, where the proposal originated, would certainly not spend that much money, particularly under President Trump who prides himself on extracting monetary concessions from other countries.\n",
      "Even if one assumes, hypothetically, that the money can be secured, Kushner's approach would never boost the development of the Palestinian economy. The proposal mentions South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Japan but he ignores the fact that these are sovereign states which have full authority over their national resources.\n",
      "By contrast, the Palestinian Authority has no control over borders, infrastructure, ports and airports, land, water and other resources. It does not even have full control over its own budget. Right now public servants are not getting paid in full because the occupying power, Israel, has decided to take a portion of the funds allocated for salaries.\n",
      "The development and prosperity that Kushner is promising can only happen if the Israeli occupation is lifted. As Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi neatly put it in a recent tweet, \"first lift the siege of Gaza, stop the Israeli theft of our land, resources &funds, give us our freedom of movement & control over our borders, airspace, territorial waters etc. Then watch us build a vibrant prosperous economy as a free & sovereign people.\"\n",
      "Although Kushner's economic plan purportedly focuses on economic development, it has serious political implications for the conflict. Trump's son-in-law openly stated that the Saudi-led Arab Peace Initiative is no longer on the table. His plan also treats Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, and Israel as equal partners and does not mention the Israeli state as a party to the conflict.\n",
      "The wording of the text offers a glimpse of what the political addendum of the \"deal of the century\" could look like - devoid of solutions for major Palestinian issues and full of concessions for the Israeli side. Yet its provisions are still unknown, as its announcement of the complete deal was delayed for a fifth time.\n",
      "With all these major flaws, it was hardly surprising that the Bahrain Workshop failed to jump-start a process that could bring together parties interested in the future of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict or lay the foundations of a collaboration on economic projects. Kushner's pledge of $50bn failed to inspire both potential donors and potential beneficiaries, like Egypt, Jordan, and Lebanon.\n",
      "The Palestinians, who have been divided since 2007, united against the workshop and rejected its proposals. Even former American policymakers who spent most of their careers focusing on the Palestinian-Israel conflict have not supported the plan, including Dennis Ross, special envoy for the Middle East peace process under the Bush administration.\n",
      "All in all, it is quite clear that Kushner's \"deal of the century\" was never really meant as a serious proposal to resolve the conflict or provide a vision for how to move forward. Rather all this time, it has been a useful distraction from the implementation of another plan that aims to further entrench the Israeli occupation of Palestine. The Trump administration has already made a few major steps in this direction, including recognising Israel's annexation of Jerusalem and the Golan Heights.\n",
      "While the world's attention was focused on the preparations for the Bahrain Workshop, national security adviser John Bolton visited Israel and toured the occupied Jordan Valley. It is quite likely that next step will be US recognition of Israel's annexation of parts of the West Bank, where over 600,000 illegal Israeli settlers currently live.\n",
      "In this sense, waiting for the announcement of the \"deal of the century\" is a waste of time and paying attention to Kushner's theatrics means falling into his trap set up to distract the public from what is really going on. All those who care for the Palestinian cause should mobilise now and prevent Kushner, Trump and their Israeli partners from establishing irreversible \"facts on the ground\" that could see Palestinian hopes for self-determination destroyed.\n",
      "The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance. The economic impact of same-sex marriage Three countries legalised same-sex marriage in 2019, some citing its economic benefits. When Christie Caruso, 31, and Sarah West, 29, were planning their wedding, they knew it was going to be big.\n",
      "\"Weddings are very important in my family,\" Caruso told Al Jazeera. \"We're Italian, we have a big family, everyone wants to be there, so it was going to be somewhat expensive, and Sarah also has a big Italian family who feels the same way.\"\n",
      "So Caruso, an event planner, and West, a school counsellor, budgeted $40,000 for their wedding. They married on July 1, 2017, in Connecticut, decked out in beautiful white dresses and surrounded by bridesmaids and groomsmen in blue. For the pair, the day symbolised something more than a sweet ceremony and a big party: the acceptance of their love as a same-sex couple.\n",
      "\"It was important for us to have such a big wedding because everybody that we know accepts it, and that was really important for us: just showing people that we love each other,\" Caruso said. \"Even if you don't understand it, we want you to see we love each other just as a man and a woman do.\"\n",
      "In the four years since the US Supreme Court legalised same-sex marriage in all 50 states through the Obergefell v Hodges decision, same-sex marriage rates have climbed, and 10.2 percent of LGBT Americans were married to a same-sex partner in 2017, up from 9.6 percent the year before, a Gallup poll found.\n",
      "Around the world, a total of 24 countries have legalised same-sex marriage, according to the World Population Review. Most recently, Taiwan became the first place in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage on May 24, and during the debate over the measure, several major multinational companies spoke out about the economic boost the island could expect from legalisation, Reuters reported.\n",
      "Researchers have found that aside from granting same-sex couples the same rights, respect, recognition and benefits as heterosexual couples, legalising same-sex marriage has economic benefits in both the short and long term.\n",
      "Weddings profit states\n",
      "Those benefits start with the economic boost from weddings like Caruso and West's, according to researchers at the Williams Institute, an independent think-tank at the UCLA School of Law that conducts research on public policies around sexual orientation and gender identity.\n",
      "Around the world, a total of 24 countries have legalised same-sex marriage, according to the World Population Review. [Christie Caruso and Sarah West/Al Jazeera]\n",
      "Williams Institute Senior Counsel Christy Mallory and her team estimated wedding-related spending by same-sex couples over the first three years of marriage equality in each state, including the effect on state and local tax revenue and tourism dollars from out-of-town wedding guests. Same-sex couples \"pump money into state economies as they plan their weddings and celebrate their milestone,\" they found.\n",
      "\"Together, those reports found that after marriage had been extended in all states, a combined total of $2.6bn could be generated, leading to $184.7m in state and local tax revenue and supporting 13,000 jobs,\" Mallory told Al Jazeera.\n",
      "And the economic effect of same-sex weddings in the year immediately after the landmark 2015 Supreme Court decision was huge, Mallory and the Williams Institute team found in their research.\n",
      "\"We estimated that 123,000 same-sex couples married in that year, which boosted state and local economies by an estimated $1.58bn, generating an estimated $102m in tax revenue and supporting up to 18,900 jobs in the year,\" Mallory said.\n",
      "Economic view of marriage\n",
      "Aside from the immediate economic effect of same-sex weddings, there are longer-term economic benefits tied to marriage in general. Nobel Laureate economist Gary Becker first outlined an economic view of marriage in 1973, finding that married couples are able to produce more by pooling their resources, most notably time and money. It's a reality Caruso has seen in her own life.\n",
      "\"It's great, because being together, we have been able to split everything like rent and utilities. Sarah makes a little bit more than me, so she pays for the cars and the insurance, but then I'll get groceries or any shopping that we need,\" Caruso said. \"When I was single, I really had to worry about stuff like that, because it's expensive living on your own.\"\n",
      "Aside from the immediate economic effect of same-sex weddings, there are longer-term economic benefits tied to marriage in general.  [Christie Caruso and Sarah West/Al Jazeera]\n",
      "The couple rents an apartment in Bayonne, New Jersey, but hopes to buy a house in Connecticut, she said. Caruso said they balance saving for the down payment with day-to-day expenses as well as unforeseen ones, like getting their car fixed for a couple of hundred dollars when it broke down. And marriage has changed the way Caruso thinks about money, she said.\n",
      "\"When I was single, I would go out and spend money like it was nothing, which isn't really the best thing to be doing, and Sarah is more of a person who likes to save,\" Caruso said. \"So getting married, that was really important to her for me to understand that we need to save money if we want to have children, buy a house and things like that.\"\n",
      "Dividing household tasks among two partners also allows everyone to do more, Becker found. That's also true in Caruso and West's household, she said.\n",
      "\"Sarah will cook dinner for us every night, and I'll do laundry,\" Caruso explained. \"We're very good at communicating and knowing how to split the work that needs to be done in our house so it's pretty much equal for each other, so one person is not doing so much more than the other.\"\n",
      "Couples who live together and are not married also see this bump in their ability to produce more, but there's more negotiation that has to go on, Becker found. Unmarried couples may also stay together for a shorter period of time, according to Wendy Manning, a sociology professor and the director of the Center for Family and Demographic Research and co-director for the National Center for Family and Marriage Research at Bowling Green State University.\n",
      "\"Cohabited couples are usually shorter term if they're not married, which doesn't mean they're not committed to one another, but they are more fragile than marriages,\" Manning told Al Jazeera. \"There is also something about people who decide to get married, that once you made that commitment, you're less likely to break up.\"\n",
      "But as a generation, millennials are waiting longer to get married, and much of it has to do with their sense of economic stability. The median age for first marriage hit its highest point on record last year: 30 years old for men and 28 years old for women, according to US Census Bureau data cited by the Pew Research Center.\n",
      "Some of that delay is due to student loan debt, Manning said, which is causing millennials to put off everything from marriage to buying a home to having children. Homeownership rates for millennials aged 25 to 32 dropped nine percentage points between 2005 and 2014, a report by the Federal Reserve found, and the Fed attributed roughly 20 percent of the decline in homeownership among young adults to student loan debt, which has doubled in the last decade to about $1.5 trillion.\n",
      "Saving for children\n",
      "Millennials are waiting longer to have kids, too; the fertility rate in the US hit a 32-year low in 2018, according to the National Vital Statistics Report. While different-sex couples might put off having kids while they establish themselves in their careers or pay down student debt, same-sex couples have those as well along with other financial considerations before they start a family.\n",
      "Many same-sex couples have to factor in the legal fees associated with adoption or the costs associated with artificial insemination, in-vitro fertilisation and other assisted reproductive technology in their \"pathway to parenthood,\" Manning said, \"and certainly that's going to be more expensive.\"\n",
      "\"For same-gender couples who want to have families, these issues surrounding debt could be even greater for them. Just to form their families is going to be expensive, and then they're going to have some of the same issues as different-gender couples in terms of paying for childcare, schooling and other daily expenses that occur,\" Manning said.\n",
      "Same-sex couples filing joint tax returns in the US are \"generally younger, higher income, and less likely to claim dependent children,\" according to a Brookings Institute analysis of tax return data. [Christie Caruso and Sarah West/Al Jazeera]\n",
      "Same-sex couples filing joint tax returns in the US are \"generally younger, higher income, and less likely to claim dependent children,\" an analysis of tax return data by the Brookings Institute found. But while 48 percent of different-sex couples claimed children as dependents on their tax returns in 2015, only 28 percent of female-female couples did and only seven percent of male-male couples did, Brookings found.\n",
      "Caruso said she and her wife started a special savings account they plan to use to each have a child via artificial insemination someday. She anticipates it would cost $2,000 for each of them to get pregnant and have a child using the same donor sperm, but the couple wants to set aside $10,000 total in case either of them is unable to get pregnant on the first try. It is a challenge to save that money as well as a down payment for a house, she said.\n",
      "\"It's very expensive for same-sex couples to want to have children. Adopting is definitely a cheaper way to do it, and we have thought about that, but we would definitely like one of us to have a baby, hopefully me first, if it's possible,\" Caruso said. \"We definitely have our little savings account for having a child because it's just expensive. It's going to take some time, but we'll get there probably in about a year or two.\"\n",
      "Marriage equality at risk?\n",
      "But with a conservative-leaning Supreme Court, some couples worry marriage equality in the US could be undermined. On June 17, the Supreme Court threw out an Oregon court's ruling against a bakery that refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. Discrimination against LGBT individuals and same-sex couples remains a major issue in the US.\n",
      "Caruso said she has a simple message for those who don't understand same-sex couples.\n",
      "\"We're doing the same exact thing that everybody else is doing, it's just we're both women,\" she said. They are also now contributing to economic growth in a new way: as a legally married couple. \"We're paying bills like everybody else, we're going grocery shopping like everybody else, we're working every day trying to save up like everyone else is trying to do. That's just it.\" Millions of pigs culled as swine fever spreads through Asia UN body urges Asian states to tackle what's being described as the largest animal disease outbreak in history.

Vietnam has been the hardest hit, culling at least 2.6 million pigs followed by China, which reported more than 1.1 million. All the figures were provided to the FAO by governments of countries affected by the epidemic.\n",

      "In South Korea, where diets rely heavily on pork, there is concern an outbreak could hurt an industry with 6,300 farms raising more than 11 million pigs.\n",
      "\"Animal disease containment in its broadest sense should be prioritised within the highest levels of governments,\" the FAO said, warning: \"Outbreak control strategies must be in place.\" China has reported 139 outbreaks in all but two of its 34 provinces.\n",

Trade tensions kick Asian business confidence to 10-yr low: Poll The global trade war, Brexit and a slowing Chinese economy were the main reasons for the more pessimistic outlook.

World's top bicycle maker says 'Made in China' era is over Giant began moving US-bound production from China back to its Taiwan plants as soon as Trump threatened trade action. Giant Manufacturing Co. saw the writing on the wall early on. The world's biggest bicycle maker started moving production of U.S.-bound orders out of its China facilities to its home base in Taiwan as soon as it heard Donald Trump threaten tariff action in September.\n",
      "\"When Trump announced the plan of 25% tariffs, we took it seriously,\" Chairwoman Bonnie Tu said in an interview at Giant's Taichung City headquarters in Taiwan. \"We started moving before he shut his mouth.\"\n",
      "Giant is part of a growing number of global firms that are pivoting production out of China in reaction to the increasingly hostile trade relations between the two superpowers. Intel Corp. this week became the latest to say it's reviewing its global supply chain, while Li & Fung Ltd., the world's largest supplier of consumer goods, said the trade war is spurring it to diversify away from China.\n",
      "\"Last year, I noticed that the era of Made In China and supplying globally is over,\" Tu said. The maker of mountain and racing bicycles closed one plant in China at the end of 2018 and shifted most U.S. orders out of the country. Giant announced last July it is setting up a factory in Hungary \"as moving production close to your market is a trend.\"\n",
      "Giant currently has one plant each in Taiwan and the Netherlands, and still has five remaining in China. The Taiwanese site will be working double shifts to keep up with the relocated orders. The company said it is seeking a partner in Southeast Asia.\n",
      "Not Level\n",
      "\"The world is no longer flat,\" said Tu, borrowing from Thomas Friedman's book \"The World Is Flat,\" whose title in a metaphor for viewing the world as a level playing field for companies and trade. \"The concept is no longer affordable in every place.\"\n",
      "Li & Fung's chief executive officer echoed Tu's sentiments, saying China became the factory to the world because it is so efficient in producing goods. Sourcing became very easy, CEO Spencer Fung said in a presentation in Hong Kong on Monday.\n",
      "\"They just put all their eggs in the China basket because the Chinese are very capable,\" said Fung. Now, \"the trade war is basically forcing people to rethink their entire global sourcing strategy and to diversify away from China.\"\n",
      "Giant shares soared 9.8% on Monday for their biggest gain ever, after the company said it expects a quarter of its revenue this year to come from e-bikes. The stock fluctuated between gains and losses early Tuesday. Li & Fung jumped as much as 6.4%, the most in three months, in Hong Kong Tuesday.\n",
      "Giant's willingness to quickly steer orders away from the tariff-hit Asian nation - long regarded as the world's low-cost workshop - has been noticed by investors and analysts. The stock, which doesn't carry a single sell rating from brokerages tracked by Bloomberg, has climbed almost 80% this year to the highest level since 2015, after four straight years of declines.\n",
      "Giant's global brand awareness and flexible manufacturing are key to avoiding tariff risks, Daiwa analysts Helen Chien and Anita Li wrote in a June 5 report, in which they initiated coverage of Giant with an outperform rating.\n",
      "Tariffs are adding $100 on average to the price of bicycles made in China and exported to the U.S., compared with those made in zero-tariff areas, Tu said, explaining the rationale for the switch to the Taiwanese site.\n",
      "The switch, however, comes with higher costs for employee payouts, automation and no China-like economy of scale for suppliers. Tu declined to peg the relocation costs beyond saying the company's \"bottom line would be better without the U.S.-China trade war.\"\n",
      "That's why Giant is open to reverting production to its Chinese plants if the U.S. and China are able to hammer out a trade deal. If America \"decides to remove the 25% tariff, we will move the production back to China right away,\" Tu said. Hong Kong's lame duck? Leader Lam faces fight for political life As calls for her resignation become louder, analysts say Carrie Lam pays the price for political miscalculations. Hong Kong, China - As an estimated two million people took to the streets on Sunday, the people of Hong Kong for the second time appeared to have rendered their leader a lame duck amid calls for her resignation.\n",
      "Leader Carrie Lam, who was chosen in 2017 by a small committee of electors with the approval of Beijing, has made a series of spectacular political miscalculations in her handling of a legislative bill that would have amended Hong Kong's extradition laws to allow for criminal renditions to mainland China.\n",
      "A career bureaucrat who rose through the ranks in the British colonial administration, Lam failed to take into account the deep mistrust in Hong Kong for both China and its legal system.\n",
      "The bill prompted four major protests between April and June, with one on Wednesday ending with riot police firing tear gas and rubber bullets at largely peaceful protesters.\n",
      "Two record-breaking marches - on Sunday, June 16, and a week earlier - also drew a wide cross-section of Hong Kong society, including many ordinary people who said they did not regularly attend demonstrations.\n",
      "Although Hong Kong returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, many residents still value the city's unique history, civil liberties, and strong rule of law that has attracted so many foreign companies to make Hong Kong their Asian headquarters. They also deeply value Hong Kong' autonomy from China, which was promised until 2047, but many say it has been under attack in recent years.\n",
      "\"Basically she is in an impossible situation to govern because she has lost the basic trust of the people, respect from the business community and even she has lost the respect of the pro-establishment legislators,\" said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong's Center for China Studies.\n",

      "Hong Kong's controversial extradition bill explained\n",
      "Lam said her immediate resignation was unlikely as there was no clear successor, but her tenure is effectively over as a leader with any clout.\n",
      "\"She will be given a face-saving period, a kind of a grace period. She may be able to serve one to two more years or even serve out the rest of her term which runs to the middle of 2022, but she will then step down definitely. There's no hope for a second term,\" he said.\n",
      "Beijing's behind the scenes influence\n",
      "While it is unclear whether the extradition bill originated in Hong Kong or Beijing, Lam has been the public face of the bill since it was first introduced in February. Lam said on Saturday that she was deeply moved by a murder case last year, when Chan Tong-kai, a 19-year-old Hong Kong man, killed his girlfriend while the pair were on holiday in Taiwan before fleeing home.\n",
      "Hong Kong and Taiwan's government in Taipei do not share a long-term extradition agreement or formal diplomatic relations, so Chan could only be convicted for the crime of money laundering and not murder, according to the South China Morning Post.\n",
      "The legislative bill would have allowed for Hong Kong to extradite to locations where it lacks a long-term agreement on a case-by-case basis, including Taiwan but also former European colony Macau as well as the mainland.\n",

      "Beijing for its part has backed Lam's version of events and said the idea originated in Hong Kong, according to a BBC interview with Liu Xiaoming, China's ambassador to the UK.\n",
      "Lam is in a similar predicament as Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong's first chief executive under Chinese rule. Tung's government caused a similar political crisis when it tried to introduce national security legislation, known in Hong Kong as Article 23, that would have brought the city's laws in line with the mainland.\n",
      "About half a million people marched against the bill on July 1, 2003, according to protest organisers, forcing Tung to suspend the bill indefinitely.

Plunge in Singapore's exports highlights Asian economic troubles Analysts blame a fall in demand from China as it adjusts to an ongoing trade war with the United States. A steep drop in exports from Singapore, one of the world's most trade-dependent economies, is an indicator of the troubles facing many Asian countries because of the trade war between the United States and China, analysts said on Monday.\n",
      "The Southeast Asian country's exports, excluding oil, fell 15.9 percent in May compared with the same month last year, according to Enterprise Singapore, a government body that tracks trade figures. It was the biggest decline since March 2016, and partly driven by a fall in demand for electronics, one of Singapore's main manufacturing industries.\n",
      "Compared with April, Singapore's exports grew by 6.2 percent in May.\n",
      "\"Geographically, exports to the Greater China area [mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan] contributed most to the decline,\" CMC Markets analyst Margaret Yang Yan said in a research note.\n",
      "\"This reading came in line with an 8.5 percent slump in China's total imports in May. As trade tensions show no sign of easing soon, a slowing of China's demand will continue to have [a] big impact to South East Asian economies,\" she wrote.\n",
      "Global electronics slump\n",
      "The drop in Singapore's exports also reflects a global fall in demand for electronics, said Robert Carnell, chief economist and head of research for the Asia-Pacific region at Dutch bank ING, in a research note.\n",
      "\"The trade war is damaging Asia, but it is the global technology slump (of which China's technology war with the US is only a recent part) which is doing the most damage to exports in the region,\" Carnell said.\n",
      "Last month Singapore cut its 2019 economic growth forecast to between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent. Its economy grew at the slowest pace in a decade in the first quarter, hit by a contraction in manufacturing as the China-US trade dispute intensified.\n",
      "According to the latest available World Bank figures, exports of goods and services amounted to more than 173 percent of Singapore's gross domestic product in 2017. Only Luxembourg and Hong Kong's economies were more dependent on exports.\n",
      "Jeff Ng, an economist at Continuum Economics, noted that Singapore mostly exports finished products to China, and currently Chinese demand for such goods is low.\n",
      "\"(Trade tensions) certainly affected confidence. It's not necessarily the main determinant of weaker growth, but it has affected businesses' confidence,\" Ng told the Reuters news agency.\n",
      "On May 10, Trump hiked tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods up to 25 percent and took steps to levy duties on an additional $300bn in Chinese goods. Beijing retaliated with tariff hikes on a revised list of $60bn in US goods.\n",
      "A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said last week that China will respond firmly if the US insists on escalating trade tensions.\n",
      "A day earlier, US President Donald Trump said he would slap tariffs on the additional $300bn worth of Chinese goods if a deal to resolve trade tensions is not reached when G20 leaders gather in Osaka, Japan later this month. Deep divisions over what Hong Kong bill will do to rights Protesters and government dig in over controversial extradition bill that critics fear will destroy Hong Kong freedoms.

      "A main point of contention, according to Phillip Dykes, chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association, \"is with the concern that people have - that if returned to the mainland, they will be entering into a judicial system that has been described as capricious, opaque and liable to manipulation,\" he said.\n",

      "One pro-China group, wich calls itself Safeguard Hong Kong, has been circulating a petition in support of the bill. The group's website said it had more than 900,000 signatures on Friday morning.\n",
      "Dykes says comparisons with other extradition laws are invalid because China clearly has the upper hand over Hong Kong, which is a special administrative region within China rather than a country in its own right.\n",
      "\"Unlike true extradition, from nation to nation, there is an asymmetrical relationship here,\" Dykes told Al Jazeera. \"Though cases will be scrutinised by the courts, the ultimate decision is whether the chief executive will comply and people have very little confidence that she [Carrie Lam] will stand up to Beijing.\"\n",
      "While the proposals might not have an immediate effect on the average resident, Dykes says the changes would have \"a chilling ripple effect as mainland law leaches into Hong Kong\" noting recent incidents including the decision to revoke the visa of veteran British correspondent Victor Mallett, the disqualification of elected officials, and the disappearance of five local booksellers who were known for publishing works critical of China's leaders.\n",

      "The 70-member assembly or Legco would have no role in the process.\n",
      "Hong Kong's courts would have the opportunity to review any decision, but they would not be allowed to inquire into the \"quality of justice\" the accused would receive or whether they were guilty of the alleged offence.\n",
      "\"The courts will have very little power to reject any extradition request,\" said MK Tam, director of Amnesty International Hong Kong.\n",
      "\"It's not a formal prosecution so you cannot examine the evidence presented by the other side. We all know that if they want to prosecute someone - a human rights defender or activist - actually in mainland China the charges are political in nature but they use other laws to prosecute them, like tax evasion, for example.\"\n",
      "The amendments will cover some 37 offences, including fraud and other white-collar crimes.\n",
      "The administration announced a series of changes at the end of May that included setting the threshold for considering extradition requests to crimes punishable by at least seven years of imprisonment, as well as setting a time limit on the date of offences to prevent retrospective requests.\n",
      "It has also said that only China's highest court and its top prosecutor would be able to file an extradition request and that the chief executive would be allowed to order any jurisdiction requesting extradition to respect the presumption of innocence, the right to appeal, open trial and other international judicial norms.\n",
      "Only the seven-year term would actually be written into the bill.\n",
      "The administration has also proposed amendments to mutual legal assistance, which would allow outside investigators to request assistance from Hong Kong for criminal cases including search and seizure, and confiscation and restraint orders.\n",
      "Since mainland China's police and officials are not allowed to operate in Hong Kong, lawyers say those changes could also have a significant impact.\n",

      "Geng Shuang, a ministry spokesman, told a daily news briefing in Beijing that China called on the US to stop arms sales to Taiwan to avoid harming bilateral ties.\n",
      "The developments come as China and the US are engaged in an increasingly acrimonious battle over trade and technology. Washington has imposed up to 25 percent tariffs on $250bn in imports from China and is preparing to increase import duties on another $300bn.\n",
      "Beijing has responded by imposing tariffs on $60bn worth of US products, which went into effect on June 1.\n",

      "US arms sales to the self-ruled island comply with the 40-year-old US Taiwan Relations Act and are based on an assessment of the island's defence needs.

      "The Stingers meanwhile could help strengthen Taiwan's defences against China, which has more than 1,000 advanced fighter aircraft and 1,500 accurate missiles pointing at the island.\n",
      "Taiwan, which split from China amid a civil war in 1949, has had no formal diplomatic ties with the US since Washington recognised Beijing in 1979.

      "This is the lowest World Bank forecast for the global economy since 2016.\n",
      "Rising trade barriers, a buildup of government debt and what the World Bank said are \"deepening slowdowns\" in major economies are all contributing to slower global economic growth, noted David Malpass, the World Bank's new president. These factors are \"worrisome\", he said, because \"ongoing investment is needed for continued growth\".\n",
      "\"Because of slowing global growth, elevated policy uncertainty and limited fiscal space, investment growth in developing economies is expected to stay weak and below historical averages,\" Malpass said.\n",
      "On January 8 the World Bank projected global growth to \"soften\", and at that time, it revised its global forecast down from 3 percent to 2.9 percent for 2019. But as US President Donald Trump has ramped up his rhetoric around global trade, positive sentiment on the global economy has taken a hit.\n",

      "In a signal to policymakers around the world, Kose now believes action by them is warranted to help stabilise the global economy.\n",
      "\"Policymakers need to act with a sense of urgency to reduce uncertainty and take steps to improve confidence,\" he said. \"This will promote growth and stability.\"\n",
      "Details in the data\n",
      "The global economy is facing headwinds. Manufacturing, construction and services data across multiple economies all came in weaker for the month of April. Activity also slowed considerably over the past several months, and this slowdown has not been limited to the United States alone.\n",
      "The economies of Malaysia, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan all experienced slower manufacturing activity in April. Europe, including manufacturing powerhouse Germany - a major trading partner of the US - also saw declines.\n",

      "Police authorities put the turnout at 37,000.\n",

      "\"People are really afraid of a new extradition law that is coming into effect that would allow people to be shipped over the border to mainland China to face trial ... so people are [worried] that China has slowly been chipping away at Hong Kong's rights, chipping away at Hong Kong's legal system,\" he added.\n",
      "In comparison, authorities in mainland China, where the anniversary remains taboo, deployed a security blanket in and around Tiananmen Square. China has never provided a death toll for the 1989 violence. Rights groups and witnesses say it could run into the thousands.\n",

      "\"[In the past] 30 years, China, under the Communist Party, has undergone many changes. Do you think the government was wrong with the handling of June 4th? There was a conclusion to that incident. That was a political turmoil, that the central government needed to quell,\" Fenghe added.\n",
      "But analysts believe that the course of action China has taken has not led to good changes.\n",
      "Richburg said the Chinese government has been able to successfully control dissent through several means, including creating \"a massive surveillance state.\n",
      "\"They have also been able to isolate themselves by wrapping themselves in the nationalist flag, so any criticism of China becomes a criticism of the Chinese people and the Chinese culture .. the government has also been insulated by a very strong economy, they have been saying ... leave us alone to rule the country, and we will keep the economy growing ... just don't get involved in politics.\"\n",

Signs of a global recession? Factory activity is slowing down Analysts say the trade war is morphing into a tech and broad-based business war that could lead to a global recession. Factory activity slowed in the United States, Europe and Asia last month as an escalating trade war between China and the administration of US President Donald Trump raised fears of a global economic downturn and added new pressure on policymakers to step up support.\n",
      "Growth indicators such as factory orders are likely to deteriorate further in coming months as higher trade tariffs take their toll on commerce and impact any positive business and consumer sentiment. This could lead to job losses and delays with investment decisions.\n",

That summit - called the G20 - is scheduled to take place on June 28-29. Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping could meet at the event.\n",
      "The US-China trade war, declining car sales and Brexit, Britain's proposed exit from the European Union, all took their toll on manufacturing activity in May.\n",
      "Separate surveys by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM, a supply management association) and IHS Markit Ltd (a London-based information provider) showed that the US experienced a slowdown in manufacturing activity growth. The ISM's reading of 52.1 was a surprise decline and the worst showing since October 2016. And the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) from IHS Markit came in at its lowest level since the 2009 global financial crisis.\n",
      "Data on construction from the US Commerce Department showed that spending showed no change in April, disappointing expectations. But this report also included upward revisions of data from the first quarter.\n",
      "The data was largely collected before the escalation in trade tensions last week as Trump threatened new tariffs against Mexico. In the same week, Trump also decided to end preferential trade treatment for India.\n",
      "Market prices appeared to reflect higher chances of a recession, and interest rate cuts by central banks including the US central bank (the Federal Reserve also known as the Fed). Based on short-term interest-rate futures, traders seemed to think the Fed could begin cutting rates as soon as next month.\n",
      "\"There was a big change in the bond market,\" Cornerstone Macro LLC researcher Roberto Perli said of these developments. \"We don't like to utter the word 'recession' lightly, but the bond market reaction on Friday in response to the Mexico tariff news was ominous.\"\n",
      "Earlier data showed manufacturing activity contracting at a faster pace in the eurozone during the month of May, and British manufacturers also saw their steepest downturn in almost three years. The economies of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Taiwan also all saw their manufacturing activity contract.\n",
      "After an official gauge on Friday showed contraction in China, the Caixin/IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI showed modest expansion, offering investors some near-term relief.\n",

China sneezes: Asian factories feel chill of US-China dispute Latest surveys of factory owners in China and other Asian countries show activity slowing down. Hong Kong - As Asia's largest economy, China is a place where what happens these days is almost certain to be felt across the region. So it's little surprise that new figures pointing to weakness in China’s factories are also being reflected elsewhere.\n",
      "A keenly watched private gauge of Chinese manufacturing activity, the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), released on Monday by market research firm Caixin/Markit, came in at 50.2 for May. A figure above 50 indicates activity is increasing, while anything below that suggests a contraction. It was unchanged from the previous month.\n",
      "But an official survey carried out by the government and released on Friday suggests that factory activity is shrinking. China's National Bureau of Statistics figure was 49.2.\n",
      "Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Taiwan also showed a slowdown in manufacturing. The figure for Vietnam indicated growth, though at a slower pace than in April. One bright spot in the region was the Philippines, where manufacturing growth expanded.\n",
      "China sources components from around Asia, so any contraction in demand for Chinese goods gets passed along to companies that supply factories there.\n",
      "Analysts say factory owners in China are becoming warier of the potential effects of the trade war with the United States on their businesses.\n",
      "\"The sharp downturn[s] in confidence in the external sector were the main drags on the headline PMI, with the new export and import orders sub-indices falling to 46.5 and 47.1 respectively, more than two percentage points from April,\" Koh Hui Koon, an analyst from Fitch Group, told Al Jazeera.\n",
      "Koh says the hardening rhetoric from both sides suggests trade tensions will remain elevated over the coming months, likely keeping PMI readings under pressure.\n",
      "'Front loading'\n",
      "In the run-up to the latest round of tit-for-tat tariffs between the world's two biggest economies, many importers in both China and the US were stockpiling goods to beat implementation deadlines, creating extra demand for manufacturers, so-called \"front loading\".\n",
      "\"In the past, we might have seen front-loading effects lift the headline PMI, primarily through strengthening new export orders,\" Nick Marro, an analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, told Al Jazeera.\n",

US will no longer 'tiptoe' around China's behaviour: Shanahan Acting US defence secretary mixes sharp criticism of China and warnings of North Korean threat at Shangri-La conference. US Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan has said that Washington will no longer \"tiptoe\" around China's behaviour in Asia.\n",
      "In his first major speech on the international stage, Shanahan on Saturday mixed sharp criticism of China and warnings of North Korea's \"extraordinary\" threat with vows that the US will remain strongly committed to the Indo-Pacific region and is ready to invest billions of dollars in securing its stability.\n",
      "\"Perhaps the greatest long-term threat to the vital interests of states across this region comes from actors who seek to undermine, rather than uphold, the rules-based international order,\" he said, at the Shangri-La Dialogue conference in Singapore.\n",
      "While he didn't specifically name China in early parts of his speech at Asia's biggest security gathering, he made clear who his target was, making pointed references to Beijing's campaign to put advanced weapons systems on disputed islands in the region.\n",
      "\"If these trends in these behaviours continue, artificial features in the global commons could become tollbooths. Sovereignty could become the purview of the powerful,\" Shanahan said.\n",
      "\"We're not going to ignore Chinese behaviour and I think in the past people have kind of tiptoed around that,\" Shanahan said later, in answer to a question.\n",

      "Tariff rivalry: Midwestern farmers feels the pinch (02:18) Chinese tourism to US drops for first time in 15 years Tourist arrivals from China to the US fell nearly six percent last year, according to a US government agency After more than a decade of rapid growth, Chinese travel to the US is falling. And that has cities, malls and other tourist spots scrambling to reverse the trend.\n",
      "Travel from China to the US fell 5.7 percent in 2018 to 2.9 million visitors, according to the National Travel and Tourism Office, which collects data from US Customs forms. It was the first time since 2003 that Chinese travel to the US slipped from the prior year.\n",
      "Friction between the US and China is one reason for the slowdown. The Trump administration first imposed tariffs on Chinese solar panels and washing machines in January 2018, and the trade war has escalated from there. The US now has a 25 percent tariff on $200bn worth of Chinese imports, while China has retaliated with tariffs on $60bn of US imports.\n",

      "China's slowdown\n",
      "There are other reasons behind the slowdown. Economic uncertainty in China has travelers at the lower end of the market vacationing closer to home, says Wolfgang Georg Arlt, director of the Chinese Outbound Tourism Research Institute, which found that 56 percent of travelers leaving China in the last three months of 2018 went to Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan compared with 50 percent in 2017. Those who do travel farther are seeking out more exotic destinations like Croatia, Morocco and Nepal.\n",
      "Chinese travel to the US had already been moderating from its breakneck pace earlier this decade. In 2000, 249,000 Chinese visited the US. That tripled to 802,000 by 2010, then tripled again by 2015, in part because of higher incomes, better long-haul flight connections and an easing of visa restrictions, according to McKinsey, the consulting firm.\n",
      "The US welcomed more than three million Chinese visitors in 2016 and 2017. But year-over-year growth edged up just four percent in 2017, the slowest pace in more than a decade.\n",
      "Most industry-watchers agree that any downturn is temporary, since China's middle class will only continue to expand. The US government forecasts Chinese tourism will grow two percent this year to 3.3 million visitors, and will reach 4.1 million visitors in 2023.\n",
      "\"Even if the Chinese economy cools, it's still going to continue to be a very good source of growth for the travel industry,\" said David Huether, senior vice president of research for the US Travel Association.\n",
      "In general, international travel to the US has been declining. Overall data for 2018 hasn't been released yet, but international travel fell two percent in 2016 and was flat in 2017.\n",
      "But because China commands some of the highest tourism traffic to the US, any falloff will be felt by destinations that have come to rely on Chinese spending power. In 2017, the country had the fifth highest number of US-bound tourists, behind Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom and Japan.\n",

      "Ten years earlier, China wasn't even on the top 10 list, falling behind countries like Germany, France, South Korea and Australia, according to the National Travel and Tourism Office.\n",
      "China didn't crack the top 10 list until 2011 and has been climbing ever since. Spending by Chinese visitors — which doesn't include students — ballooned more than 600 percent between 2008 and 2016, to nearly $18.9bn. In 2017, that fell by 1 percent to $18.8bn, or about 12 percent of overall tourism spending.\n",
      "Getting social\n",
      "To hold onto those dollars, experts say the tourism industry must do more to keep up with Chinese travelers and their changing needs.\n",
      "Larry Yu, a professor of hospitality management at George Washington University, notes that Chinese tourists - particularly younger ones - are increasingly planning trips using social media apps like WeChat and are less likely to book through big tour groups. They have also rapidly adopted smartphone-based payment systems.\n",
      "Destinations should invest in those technologies now if they want to continue attracting Chinese tourists, says David Becker, former CEO of Attract China, a New York-based travel consultancy.\n",
      "\"A lot of companies looked at the Chinese market as easy money, but we have to be relevant to the Chinese,\" Becker said. Attract China, for instance, has helped luxury stores in Manhattan incorporate Jeenie, a live translation app, and add Alipay and WeChat Pay for mobile payments.\n",
      "Others have also been stepping up their efforts. The Beverly Center mall in Los Angeles used to cater to busloads of Chinese tourists. Now, it's focusing on small groups of less than 10 VIP shoppers, says Susan Vance, the mall's marketing and sponsorship director. The mall has also pushed stores to offer China UnionPay, a digital payment service. More than 100 stores now have it, Vance says, up from three in 2014.\n",
      "Tourism officials are also catching onto WeChat. In late 2017, Washington DC became the first US city to launch an interactive guide in the app. Chinese travelers can use it to get directions to attractions, access audio tours in Mandarin and find dining and shopping. The city's marketing office has one staff member dedicated to WeChat.\n",
      "Washington also recently launched a Welcome China program that teaches hotels, restaurants and other venues about Chinese customs and encourages them to offer things like Chinese-language menus or in-room slippers. Forty-four hotels and a handful of restaurants have signed on.\n",
      "Elliott Ferguson, president and CEO of Destination DC, the city's marketing office, said the number of Chinese tourists visiting Washington doubled in the last five years before falling slightly in 2017. But Ferguson, who traveled to China last month to meet with tourism officials, said there's still significant interest in travel to the US\n",

      "Taiwan's official Central News Agency said the meeting was the first since the self-ruling island and the US ended formal diplomatic ties in 1979.\n",
      "China considers democratically-ruled Taiwan a renegade province, threatening to reclaim the territory by force if necessary.\n",
      "Diplomatic tension between the US and China has risen in recent weeks amid an escalating trade war and Beijing's military posturing in the South China Sea, where Washington also conducts freedom-of-navigation patrols.\n",
      "Cross-strait tension\n",
      "The meeting is likely to be viewed by Taiwan as a sign of support from the administration of US President Donald Trump.\n",
      "China regularly calls Taiwan the most sensitive and important issue in its relations with the US, which has no formal ties with Taiwan but is the island's main source of arms.\n",
      "The US has in recent months increased the frequency of patrols through the strategic Taiwan Strait despite opposition from China.\n",

      "The capital's city hall will co-host an outdoor wedding party near the famous Taipei 101 skyscraper, with local and foreign dignitaries expected to attend.\n",
      "For veteran gay rights activist Chi Chia-wei, Friday's weddings are the culmination of a three-decade long fight trying to persuade successive governments to change the law.\n",
      "It was Chi who eventually petitioned Taiwan's Constitutional Court leading to a 2017 judgement that denying same-sex couples the right to marry was unconstitutional.\n",
      "Facing an imminent court deadline, parliament finally passed a bill on May 17 allowing same-sex couples to form \"exclusive permanent unions\" and another clause that would let them apply for a \"marriage registration\" with government agencies.\n",
      "\"I feel very happy that same-sex couples can finally register and be listed as each other's spouse. I am honoured to witness Friday's marriage registrations,\" Chi told told AFP news agency.\n",
      "Deep divisions\n",
      "In the last decade, Taiwan has placed itself at the vanguard of gay rights in Asia but the issue has polarised society.\n",
      "Conservative and religious groups mobilised after the court ruling and comfortably won a series of referendums last November in which voters comprehensively rejected defining marriage as anything other than a union between a man and a woman.\n",
      "Conservative lawmakers put forward rival bills that offered something closer to limited same-sex unions but those measures failed as parliament comfortably passed the gay marriage law.\n",
      "However, the new law still has restrictions not faced by heterosexual couples.\n",
      "Same-sex couples can currently only adopt their partners' biological children and can only wed foreigners from countries where gay marriage is also recognised.\n",
      "Gay rights groups say they are willing to accept partial equality for now in the hopes of winning later legal battles over issues such as adoption, surrogacy and marrying foreigners.\n",
      "Opponents have vowed to punish President Tsai Ing-wen and the politicians who supported the gay marriage law in the January 2020 elections when the Taiwanese will elect both a new president and a new parliament. Young, educated and jobless: The struggles of India's graduates Recent studies show that people with degrees find it harder to land jobs than those without. Mumbai, India - Down a dimly-lit backstreet known locally as Study Lane in central Mumbai, India's financial capital, Rohit Singh can frequently be found poring over his textbooks. He is trying to get into an expensive Masters in Business Administration (MBA) programme. And he is not alone; dozens of other students also study there, oblivious to the loud motorbikes tearing along the small road.\n",
      "\"If I get admitted to a good MBA college, then I'm sure I will get a better job,\" the Bachelor of Commerce student told Al Jazeera. \"So many people are graduates these days that it's hard to see how either the private sector or the government can provide enough employment.\"\n",
      "Singh, 21, and his friends along Study Lane feel they need to stand out in India's increasingly competitive job market, and this place offers them a chance to focus and compare notes. He also says he is escaping the distraction of his mother's TV.\n",
      "But recent evidence suggests that a sterling education record is no longer the guarantee to a good job it may once have been. Poor education standards and burdensome corporate regulation are just two of the reasons why jobs remain hard to come by for India's graduates despite enviable economic growth rates.\n",
      "According to a report released this year by the Azim Premji University's Centre for Sustainable Employment, people with a graduate degree are more than twice as likely to be unemployed than the national average. The findings are based on surveys of 160,000 households across the country. The report also says women are more likely to be unemployed than men.\n",
      "Many of the students down Study Lane are the first ones in their families to ever go to university. Government figures show the proportion of India's 18 to 23-year-olds enrolled in higher education has more than doubled to 25.8 percent from 12.6 percent in 2004. India's government hopes this figure will rise to 30 percent by 2020.\n",
      "The informal sector\n",
      "Yet, unemployment remains a major hurdle for the Indian economy and became a major issue for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in this month's election as he sought a second term.\n",
      "In February, the Business Standard newspaper published a report that it said was based on leaked government figures showing that unemployment had hit a 45-year high of 6.1 percent. Minister of Finance Arun Jaitley first said the figures were \"not final\" and later described the report as \"disinformation\". But many analysts say the data supports anecdotal evidence.\n",
      "One of the main reasons graduates and people with postgraduate degrees find it hard to land jobs is the large size of the so-called informal economy, analysts say.\n",
      "The majority of Indians work without formal contracts [File: Amit Dave/Reuters]\n",
      "More than 80 percent of Indians work in jobs without regular pay or social benefits, according to the International Labour Organization. In the cities, they are employed as street vendors, construction workers and in mom-and-pop shops, or as labourers on farms and in fields. The World Bank says agriculture accounts for 42 percent of the workforce.\n",
      "Analysts such as Amit Basole, head of the Centre for Sustainable Employment and an author of the Azim Premji University survey, told Al Jazeera that insufficient job creation in the private sector has meant that the growth of high-skilled jobs has lagged behind that of the overall economy.\n",
      "The failure to develop a large manufacturing base has been a \"big disappointment\", he added, explaining that such industries could have generated jobs \"across the skill spectrum\" and absorbed \"huge increases on the supply side of the labour market\".\n",
      "Jayati Ghosh, an economics professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi said India has lagged behind places like South Korea, Taiwan and China, where governments have invested heavily in manufacturing, infrastructure and providing companies with access to credit.\n",
      "'Openly unemployed'\n",
      "Graduates are also becoming more selective. Rising expectations mean many graduates are holding out for jobs that match their qualifications, Ghosh told Al Jazeera.\n",
      "\"As you get higher up the education scale, people are more willing to be 'openly unemployed'. If there's no jobs available and you've done your BA degree, you're not going to then become a rickshaw driver. It doesn't make sense for them,\" she said.\n",
      "For those graduates who decide to take up low-skilled work, the competition can be intense. The government remains a major source of such jobs. In a recent case reported by Indian media, nearly a third of the 93,000 applicants for 62 police courier jobs in the state of Uttar Pradesh had doctorates.\n",
      "Government jobs provide security, benefits, and relatively good pay. Minimum salaries are currently set at 18,000 rupees ($259) a month, while 67 percent of the workforce earn less than 10,000 rupees ($144).\n",
      "But for graduates like Singh, that's not good enough. He says he wants to work for a multinational company, which he hopes will pay more than the 30,000-40,000 rupees ($430-$575) monthly wage his father earned.\n",

      "In a recent survey by Aspiring Minds, a skills assessment and research firm, employers said 80 percent of Indian engineering graduates did not meet the minimum requirements of the companies looking to hire them. Many such firms say prospective candidates lack sufficient industry experience because their courses are too theoretical.\n",
      "Poorly-trained teachers, an exam system that rewards rote learning and teaching institutions that don't meet the needs of industry, are some of the reasons graduates face a skills deficit, says Varun Aggarwal, cofounder of Aspiring Minds.\n",
      "\"Few graduates have done internships or heard an industry talk and few professors discuss industry applications for the skills they teach,\" Aggarwal told Al Jazeera. \"We found over 90 percent of engineering graduates are not even able to write ten lines of code,\" a major reason why many large companies are investing in sizeable training campuses and three- to six-month long bridging courses.\n",
      "The government has tried to offer alternatives to the typical college or university route through skilling and vocational training programmes like the National Skill Development Corporation and Skill India scheme. But with a lack of available data and follow-up surveys, experts have found it difficult to assess their effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We do know, however, that the emphasis has been on meeting targets and pushing people through the programme, with no clarity on them securing jobs or gaining employable skills,\" says Basole of the Centre for Sustainable Employment.\n",
      "Despite the odds apparently being stacked against him, Singh remains optimistic that an MBA and good old-fashioned hard work are his tickets out of the backstreets of Mumbai. \"My father has always told me one thing - whatever you do, do it well and you will be fine,\" he said.

Ruthless and sophisticated: How hackers exploit new tech A new study shows internet-connected devices and employees are being used to steal data and money from organisations. Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia - Whether you're a homemaker or a CEO - you are a possible target of an increasingly sophisticated and indiscriminate breed of cybercriminals.\n",
      "That's the message from the head of a company advising prominent firms in Asia on how to protect themselves from online attacks. The warning by the Kuala Lumpur-based Asia Cybersecurity Exchange coincides with the release of a global report on Wednesday by Aon, a large risk consultancy firm, showing how emerging technologies such as the so-called Internet of Things and even a company's own employees are proving to be vulnerabilities around the world.\n",
      "Analysts say Asia is particularly prone to attacks and stands to lose hundreds of billions of dollars.\n",
      "\"In 2019, the greatest challenge organisations will face is simply keeping up with and staying informed about the evolving cyber risk landscape,\" Aon said in its report.\n",
      "\"Organised crime now uses former intelligence members for more sophisticated attacks and state actors are both broadening the nature of their attacks and increasing their frequency,\" it added.\n",
      "Massive attacks\n",
      "The scale of damage that cybercriminals can inflict is also growing. A study by computer giant IBM, conducted by the Ponemon Institute, found the average cost of a data breach in 2018 was $3.86m, a 6.4 percent increase from 2017.\n",
      "In some cases, cybertheft can be many times more costly. Internet giant Yahoo had to shave $350m off the offer price of its core business when it sold the venture to Verizon in 2017. After the deal was first announced, Yahoo disclosed that it had discovered data breaches in 2013 and 2014 affecting billions of user accounts.\n",
      "Yahoo had to reduce the sale price of its internet business by $350m after cyberattack [File: Miguel Candela/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images]\n",
      "The perpetrators of the attacks on Yahoo sent users emails encouraging them to click on links that opened the door to names, dates of birth, passwords and other confidential data. Such so-called phishing attacks have successfully targeted online users for more than a decade, and continue to be used.\n",
      "Your money or your data\n",
      "The nature of cybercrime is changing, as well.\n",
      "High-profile attacks using the WannaCry and NotPetya viruses in 2017 resulted in hundreds of thousands of users being locked out of their own computers. The perpetrators demanded financial payments in return for unscrambling hard drives. Organisations like the UK's National Health Service and US logistics group FedEx reported hundreds of millions of dollars in lost productivity or damages as a result of the attacks.\n",
      "But accurately quantifying the full impact of such events can be hard.\n",
      "\"I'd say we're moving to a place where more companies are aware that they can be hit and accept the risk but find it difficult to quantify what that risk means to them,\" Andrew Mahony, Aon's Asia regional director for commercial risk solutions, told Al Jazeera.\n",
      "Often companies lose business because potential customers worry about the safety of their data after an attack, something analysts call reputational damage.\n",
      "Fong Choong Fook, CEO of the Asia Cybersecurity Exchange, an incubator for startups in the specialised field, says many firms underreport the full impact of cyberattacks.\n",
      "\"A lot of the time, the client's main concern is not so much on just financial losses,\" Fong told Al Jazeera. \"If they make certain announcements about their losses, they incur more losses in terms of their image and trust from their customers.\"\n",
      "And he says cybercriminals are becoming indiscriminate.\n",
      "\"Hackers used to be very targeted. But today hackers are just basically leveraging off ransomware, and from housewives to corporate CEOs, all of them are just targets,\" Fong said.\n",
      "Aon's report says the growth in the number of connected conferencing systems, printers, security cameras and other objects - the Internet of Things -  has created more ways for hackers to access sensitive data. These devices tend to be less secure than the servers and computers that form the backbone of a firm's IT infrastructure.\n",
      "Aon says a firm's own employees could be a growing threat to data security (File: Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images]\n",
      "Another weakness can be a company's own employees. Aon cites a recent survey of cybersecurity professionals which found that 53 percent reported their organisation had experienced an insider-related attack within the past year, either accidentally by clicking on phishing links or through malevolent behaviour.\n",
      "Asian hotspots\n",
      "Companies and governments in the US and Europe have spent billions of dollars on boosting their cyberdefences. But analysts say Asia remains a global weak spot in terms of implementing and coordinating legislation among countries. Corporate investment is also below Western levels.\n",
      "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, a supplier of chips for Apple's iPhones, suffered an attack in August by a variant of the WannaCry virus, while dozens of Asian hospitals were also hit.\n",
      "A survey of 1,300 businesses across Asia last year by consultancy firm Frost & Sullivan for Microsoft suggested that the potential losses from cybersecurity breaches could reach $1.75 trillion, or around seven percent of the total size of the region's economy.\n",
      "Even critical infrastructure such as power plants, transport and water systems in parts of Southeast Asia could be vulnerable to cyberattacks, according to one study.\n",
      "But Asia is also increasingly being used to launch attacks elsewhere. A report by US consulting firm AT Kearney points to Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam as global hotspots.
